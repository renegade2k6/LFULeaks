The induction ceremony for our fresh recruits starts now!"\nAs the military bugle blared from the platform, the latest batch of Minutemen rookies filed in. Among them stood the petite figure of Kobayakawa, drawing eyes amidst the towering recruits.\n"Huh? When did we get so desperate that we're taking in kids now?" Benson, lounging in the audience, pointed and sneered at the little girl in the crowd.\n"I wouldn't want her in my assault unit. She'd probably drop before we even reach the mission site."\n"Don't judge a book by its cover. At least, judging by the weapon she's carrying, she's no ordinary rookie." Rebecca cast an admiring glance at Kobayakawa who was confidently displaying her prowess amidst the crowd.\n"Don't underestimate the girl I rescued. Her strength has earned recognition from Commander Bolton himself," Alisa chimed in indignantly. "You better watch out not to get bested by a little girl."\n"Is that so? We'll see."\nThe opening remarks had concluded, and Bolton raised a hand to halt the squabbling among the captains, stepping forward to deliver his welcoming address: \n"The Minutemen thrive on fresh blood, and we welcome anyone with the grit to join us. Remember, the future of the Minutemen depends on each and every one of you."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405101=Alisa was the one who rescued Kobayakawa from the lab. Since the latter had no memories of her experiences before arriving there, Kobayakawa had to stay with the Minutemen temporarily, tagging along with Alisa in their daily life and missions.\nWhether it was Alisa's agile figure darting through the zombie horde to search for survivors, or Commander Bolton bravely holding his shield against the onslaught, carving a path through the undead, both left a lasting impression on Kobayakawa. Her desire to join the Minutemen and become a brave soldier like Alisa only grew stronger.\n"Join the Minutemen?" Bolton paused from polishing his shield, giving Kobayakawa's head a playful ruffle. "It's good to have that thought, but protecting the weak and defending our home is a job for grown-ups."\n"Don't underestimate me! I can handle a few zombies!"\n"Give her a chance," Alisa interjected on Kobayakawa's behalf.\n"She's helped me a lot during rescue missions, and it's clear she has some fighting skills. Besides, aren't the Minutemen always hoping for more recruits? I believe Kobayakawa can set an example."\n"Well then... Kobayakawa, can I trust you to check out the recent zombie activity reported in the northwest community?"\n"I won't let you down!" Kobayakawa replied in a determined tone, attempting a sloppy salute.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405102="Heh, you, the little squirt! You stole my mission? Got some guts, huh?" Benson stormed through the gate, confronting Kobayakawa with fury.\n"No one's ever dared to steal my missions before. You must be feeling real lucky!"\nKobayakawa, barely reaching Benson's chest in height, faced the man twice her size without a hint of fear. With hands on hips, she countered confidently,\n"My success rate in rescues is the highest on the team. Naturally, the mission was assigned to me."\n"When I was roasting zombies for barbecue, you weren't even born yet. You seem like you're just itching for a challenge. How about I let you taste the power of my flamethrower?"\n"I'd like to see you try! My Gatling gun isn't just for show."\nAs Benson's flamethrower heated up in his hand and Kobayakawa loaded her Gatling gun, the other soldiers around them abandoned any thoughts of intervening, taking cover nearby to avoid being caught in the crossfire. In the tense silence, poised on the verge of eruption, Rebecca's calm voice broke the stillness.\n"Latest intel: southeast community under attack by mutated zombies, urgent need for support. Benson, Kobayakawa, prepare to depart in half an hour."\n"You better watch out not to get burned by my flame during the fight."\n"Likewise, don't expect me to come help after I've evacuated the crowd."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405103="Today, we assess the defense capabilities of Heytex 103," Coleman announced, gesturing with the data tablet as he directed the attacker and defender to their respective positions on opposite sides of the field.\n"Ms. Fujiwara, upon my countdown, unleash your full-force attack on Heytex's control panel. Heytex, your task is to defend yourself."\n"Order received. Defense mode engaged." As the loading bar on Heytex's control panel reached completion, it retracted its shoulder turrets and assumed a defensive stance, crossing its arms in front of the control panel.\n"I won't hold back," Chihiro Fujiwara declared, readying herself for the attack. She drew her sword, its blade gleaming brilliantly in the sunlight, poised to strike with precision and force.\n"Both sides ready. 3, 2, 1â€”Attack!"\nAs the countdown concluded, Chihiro Fujiwara propelled herself into the air, her movement swift like a lightning bolt aimed at Heytex. With a resounding clang, her blade struck Heytex's mechanical arm, producing sparks upon impact but failing to breach its defense.\n"Ugh, that armor's tougher than I thought," Chihiro muttered as her attack failed, sheathing her sword and stepping aside to reassess her strategy.\n"Assessing unit damage... Control panel intact; right arm operational; left arm joint loose. Analyzing combat data... Initiating defense mode upgrade for the 103rd time..."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405104=Doris, who had tirelessly gathered clues from the ruins infested with zombies, never expected to encounter mutated zombies among the horde. When a boulder hurled by one of these mutants struck her, she found herself unable to move her leg, watching helplessly as the horde closed in on her.\n"Is this where it all ends?"\nEven Doris herself couldn't believe she still had a chance at survival. In her despair, the sound of blades slicing through the air reached her ears, and a mysterious masked man wielding twin blades effortlessly cut through the zombie horde.\n"Right, he had a khaki-green mask, skilled with blades, and was about... " Doris described the mysterious man's appearance after being rescued.\n"Collecting data for comparison..." Heytex 103 interrupted, already analyzing the gathered information. "Facial details uncertain. There's a 35% chance the subject matches Theodore's profile."\n"Theodore sacrificed himself in the zombie onslaught, didn't he? Could it be..." Doris trailed off, sensing something must be going on with Theodore.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405105=In the aftermath of the zombie apocalypse, many young people determined to defend their homes enlisted in military school. It was there that Dylan, Coleman, and Rogerâ€”still known as Theodore at the timeâ€”crossed paths.\nThe trio brimmed with vigor and aspirations for the future. They firmly believed that with their determination, they could wipe out the zombies and bring an end to the apocalypse.\n"As long as I can protect my family, zombies don't scare me one bit," Coleman declared during training, giving his chest a confident pat and flexing his muscles. "Check out these muscles. I've trained them specifically to take on zombies."\n"Combat isn't just about strength, though," Dylan remarked, casually swinging her legs while seated, her knife twirling effortlessly in her hand before she skillfully flung it, hitting the bullseye on the wall target.\n"Anyway, we'll fight together, for the future!" Theodore said, extending his fist. The three exchanged glances and fist-bumped, sealing the promise they made to each other.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405106="What exactly is this top-tier mission that's brought us all together?" Dylan asked, her interest piqued. She never imagined she'd be teaming up with Madam Mira, assisting Heytex 103 the Anti-War Activist on a mission.\n"The mission directive is to create chaos in the Zeus Group lab and aid members in retreat," displayed Heytex's control panel, detailing the mission.\n"We still don't know the identities of the members we're supposed to assist. That's only adding to my curiosity," Mira said, gently stroking the head of her police dog, which wagged its tail furiously. "Looks like Knight here's getting excited too. Foes or allies, Knight can sniff them out."\n"Remember, our mission is to cause chaos, not uncover identities," Dylan reminded.\n"My apologies, got carried away with my cop instincts... Let's get this mission started then!"\n"Target coordinates synced. Stay vigilant, everyone. I'll take the lead." Heytex, upon receiving the command, fired a shell to stir up commotion. Amidst the smoke, Mira and Dylan swiftly neutralized the guards who rushed in at the sound. In the chaos, a familiar figure brushed past Dylan and then vanished without a trace.\n"Wait... Was that... Theodore?!"</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405107=As the zombie apocalypse escalated, the virus spread across the wasteland uncontrollably. Within months, reports surfaced of the infection reaching the northern regions, even the polar countries. In a bid to unite armed forces worldwide against the undead threat, Alisa and Doris of the Minutemen formed a special brigade and journeyed to the Northern Rose Police Academy to seek cooperation from Officer Mira.\n"Officer Mira, greetings. We're a special ops team from the Minutemen, here to discuss cooperation with the academy," Alisa said, presenting the emblem that symbolized their affiliation with the Minutemen and handing over the drafted cooperation documents.\n"I've heard of the Minutemen for quite some time. It's still difficult to believe that our once pristine northern lands have succumbed to the zombie contagion in such a short time. Despite the nation's collapse and towns being razed, our police academy remains committed to protecting the vulnerable, serving as a bastion in this apocalypse. I'm delighted to forge this partnership with the Minutemen," Mira replied, her smile warm as she signed the contract.\nAnd thus, the Winter Pact was officially sealed.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405108="Don't be too hard on yourself, little girl. The weather in our northern region isn't something just anyone can endure. There's no shame in admitting defeat; it's not worth risking frostbite over," Mira said, observing Chihiro Fujiwara's fingers turning red from the cold as she stood in the snow, attempting to dissuade her.\n"No, I can tough it out," Chihiro gritted her teeth, refusing to give in. She tightened her frozen hands around the hilt of her blade, staring at the half-person-high block of ice in front of her, searching for a spot to strike that would shatter it in one blow.\n"Just a bit of cold won't make me drop my sword."\n"You're stubborn, indeed. It's time to learn the value of cooperation," Mira said, loading her gun and aiming at the ice block. "Every enemy has different weaknesses. The ice block is tough; chopping at it won't do much damage. You've got to aim at a specific spot to strike."\nBefore she finished her sentence, Mira pulled the trigger, and Chihiro swiftly followed suit, swinging her sword at the spot where the bullet struck. This time, the sturdy ice block finally shattered.\n"You see, there are plenty of benefits to teamwork."\n"...Thank you," Chihiro, always challenging herself, learned a different lesson that day.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405109=The outcasts, shunned by humans and their communities, united as co-conspirators seeking revenge against the world. Partners? We never called each other that way.\n"Boss, got some fresh intel. Those Minutemen guys are planning to set up camp near Community A. Should we...?" Max dashed into the room, eager to share the information with Enrique and hinting at possibilities.\n"Hmm, it's time to act. Who's in?"\n"Those clueless dorks with no appreciation for metal music. Count me out," Blanche waved off, still tinkering with her guitar.\n"Can we use bombs?" Quinn eagerly brandished the bomb in her hand.\n"Hey! That'd blow us up too," Max protested.\n"Bummer."\n"Looks like it's just the two of us, then. Let's go, shake things up! Dinner's on me when we get back," Seeing Quinn leaving the room, Max fixed his gaze on Barron, who was engrossed in his meal.\n"Dinner... Alright, Barron will do his best."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405110=Enrique had high expectations for tomboy Kate ever since she joined the Vindicators. He knew that one needed to keep sharpening their skills to survive in the doomsday. Therefore, he asked Blanche, who was of a similar age as Kate, to train Kate. \nOne day, Enrique introduced Blanche to Kate, "Blanche, Kate is new to our team; I need you to help her learn more about the vision of Vindicators." \nBlanche plucked her guitar strings with a nonchalant look and nodded, "Cool. C'mon, I'll show you the best melody of Vindicators; be sure to keep up with the beat!" \nKate responded resolutely, "Okay. I'll show you what I can do."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405111=When it comes to combat, Quinn, Blanche, and Betty each have their own distinct styles, but they all agree that fighting is the ultimate form of artistic expression. They firmly believe that a proper battle should give the enemy a truly unique experience.\n"My guitar belts out epic metal tunes during a fight. There's nothing quite like dying in the midst of my improvisation," Blanche couldn't help but reach for her guitar, itching to strum a tune.\n"Battles should always involve bombsâ€”big, explosive bombs that create the most dazzling spectacle, a true feast of art!" Quinn couldn't appreciate Blanche's raucous music. For her, there's nothing more enthralling than the breathtaking spectacle of "fireworks."\n"True art should be silent and enigmatic," Betty brushed her bangs aside. "I relish the moment when foes think victory is theirs...just before I disarm them. The look of astonishment on their faces is truly priceless."\nLooks like today is another day of the Vindicators having unified yet divided opinions on the "art of combat."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405112=On a moonlit night, a woman sneaked into an alley agily. That was Betty who was trying to steal something. She deftly evaded all guards and managed to fetch the item she wanted. \n"Bravo." A low and husky voice sounded behind her. Betty held her breath for a moment, and swiftly turned around, only to see Enrique - the new leader of the Vindicators applauding for her without making a sound. \nEnrique gazed at her with an admiring look, "Betty, I heard of your name before. You really got something. Impressive." \nBetty took a step back vigilantly, "I don't see what you mean. I'm a thief, and I guess I have nothing to do with Vindicators." \nEnrique shook his head with a smirk, "A thief? Huh, that's absolutely an understatement. You're an artist! Your talent shouldn't be hidden in such darkness. Join us, and you can have everything you want, I promise." \n"Your achievement today is all built on others' death and pain. Sorry, not a fan of it." \nHearing Betty's straightforward remark, Enrique shrugged it off and continued his persuasion slowly: "What you see is only the most superficial thing. We are actually keeping this city running by enforcing the "rules" of doomsday in our way, however peculiar it looked like though. Join us and I'm sure you'll see the truth of the doomed world." \nIn the moonlight, the two's eyes met. Betty struggled with her hesitation in her mind, but she knew at that moment that her decision would change her life thoroughly.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405113=The tomboy Kate was always pumped about the urban legends of those villain-natured heroes - Ricardo the Death Whip, Max the Maniac, and Buccaneer the Clown. She even decided to join the Vindicators one day as a way to get to know them. \nIn a gloomy underground exchange, Kate finally found their recruiting point. After she walked through a spooky corridor and pushed open a heavy iron door, a noisy and chaotic underground world unfolded before her. \n"New to here?" A low voice interrupted Kate's thoughts. She looked up and saw a man with the iconic tri-colored mask surveying her with a quite critical look. It was Ricardo! She recalled the name of the man she admired for ages. Yes, that's Ricardo the Death Whip! \n"Um, yes, I'm Kate, and I..." Kate replied in an over-excited tone. \nRicardo interrupted her, "We don't need any weaklings here, you know. If you wanna stay, show me what you got." \n"Don't cry if you lose." Max blew a teasing whistle. \n"The Clown will cheer for you! Carry on! Carry on! Ha-ha!" Buccaneer was amused by his typical dry humor. \nKnowing this was her only chance, Kate clenched her fists and stepped onto the sparring stage, "Okay, I'll show you what I can do!"</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405114=Barron and Buccaneer were two peculiar beings even among the Vindicators. One put everything he saw into his mouth, and the other was a cyborg who "drank" tons of oil a day as if it were coke. Their peculiar diet brought them together. \n"Geez, that piece of meat is rotten with worms. Don't you see 'em?" Buccaneer threw a surprised glance at Baron, who was just about to swallow the entire piece of meat with a nonchalant look. \nBarron nodded in appreciation of his kind-though-not-helpful warning, "All that can be put into the mouth is food. Barron LOVES food." \nBuccaneer decided to play a trick on him; he took out a can of gasoline, "Then you must want to try this: one of the most essential industrial products, with good quality of course!" \n"Oil? Not the tool for Barron; Barron does not want a stomachache." Shaking his head, Barron intuitively covered his stomach with both arms, as if recalling the pain he went through the last time he accidentally ate a can of gasoline. \n"Ha-ha, I thought you hadn't tried this 'delicacy' before. Anyway, lemme think what else I can share with you."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405115=One night, Casino, who had just concluded a fruitful gambling night, strolled on the street and stopped by a ballroom, where he was captivated by the enchanting singing inside it. He pushed open the door and peered, across the sea of audience, at Chu, the kabuki dancing on the stage. \n"Hmm...best singer and dancer in the wasteland! Who runs this place? She's mine! How much do you want, just name it." Casino then placed all he won tonight on the table. \n"S-sorry, sir. Chu is our special guest today...ugh, sh-she does not offer any other services." The owner who knew Chu's real identity explained to Casino with sweat all over his forehead. "What do you mean by she does not offer any other services? I see, just cut the crap. Tell me how much you actually want, okay? Don't worry, I'm not here for a bargain." Casino, who had always been able to handle any trouble with money, didn't get why the owner gestured him to lower his voice. He even raised his coarse voice to shout at Chu directly, "Young lady! Just name a number. I'll pay whatever it takes to buy your life!" Disrupted by Casino's rude behavior, Chu ended her performance midway and went back to the backstage. \nCasino might be good at catching every detail on a gambling table, but obviously, he was not able to read anything out of a woman's uninterested face.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405116=Everyone would agree Casino was a legend at the gambling tables. In his legendary gambling life, however, there was one gamble that he never mentioned in public â€“ he once staked his life simply to uncover the real identity below the mask of Buccaneer the Clown. \nBuccaneer, who always showed up out of nowhere at crucial moments with an unfathomable grin on his face, could cause a commotion just at perfect timing. His identity remained a mystery for years, which greatly triggered Casino's curiosity. \nNo one knew who won the bet that night, but people did see Buccaneer and Casino walking out of the casino side by side. Perhaps the rumor was true: that creepy mask itself was the real face of the clown.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405117=Lately, a number of tragic deaths of community managers in their homes drew widespread attention. After the preliminary investigation, the police identified a ballroom that all victims had visited before the cases. The head singer, Chu, thus became a key suspect in the investigation. \n"How many times do I have to tell you that I AM JUST A SINGER." Chu, who was interrogated by the police at backstage, answered impatiently with her legs crossed leisurely. "Just think about it, Sir, how can I manage to ensure the safety of every single visitor? I'm a singer, not a babysitter." \n"No one shall interrupt the performance. You don't wanna be "kissed" by my electric whip I guess." Ricardo waved his whip until he drove the police out the door before he lowered his voice and said to Chu, "We made too many bold moves these days. Now they notice us." \n"Let it be; they can't find any evidence anyway."\n"Chu! You got a performance tonight, right? See? I come all the way from the casino for your show! See you later!" \nChu, who was putting on her makeup in front of the mirror, was startled by Casino's loud voice from outside the door. She smashed the lipstick in her hand and tossed it towards Casino's direction, "That guy really got nothin' to do; make a little noise and invite the officers to look into that idiot."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405118=Inside a top-secret file kept in the Zeus Group's safe was a record of a secret known only to the five founding members of the Zeus Group. Although they now each had their own duties and rarely met each other, the secret made them work together to secure Zeus Group's top position in doomsday. \n"Ladies and Gentlemen, upon you walking out of this room, the secret will be completely sealed with the archives. The day you leak anything about it, the day Zeus Group will start to hunt you down, to the end of the world." Roland, who was the last one to sign his name on the file, sealed it and placed it in the safe. \n"You have my word, boss. I'll secure the secret with the rest of my life." Lunn said so while patting on his round belly. \n"I never do anything unnec." Black Cat responded. \n"Copy that." Laurel who stood behind Roland swore solemnly. \n"I will not mention a word of it." Park Ji-Mi took off her hat and nodded resolutely.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405119="This is the third time I've seen you guys within a single week." Park Ji-Mi fiddled with the medical tools nimbly while teasing her two patients, "As I remember, the Ops team doesn't have to report for duty at our medical section every day." \n"It's all because of the wrong intel. The target was prepared this time. Next time...next time I'll surely catch the target by his throat." Kelly, who rarely missed the target with one attack, was checking the wound on her thigh. "I'll have the Intel Team look into every detail of the targets to avoid any other occurrences like this." While Park Ji-Mi was sterilizing Laurel's arm with alcohol, Laurel still kept talking about her mission and used her other hand to hold the phone, instructing her subordinates on the follow-ups. Park Ji-Mi looked at the two workaholics with a sigh, "You two really need to take good care of yourself first!"</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405120=One day, Roland asked Laurel and Qian Qian to his office, where they had a secret conversation, "Here's the thing. I got an important mission here, and I can only entrust it to the ones I trust the most. But the mission is quite risky, you know, so I wanna know if you..." \n"The moment you saved my life, my life is yours. I'm always at your service." Laurel made clear her attitude to Roland before he finished his sentence. \n"I'll die for Zeus Group if necessary." Qian Qian, who was raised by the orphanage sponsored by the group, followed suit. Roland nodded in satisfaction, "I knew you would be the best candidates for the mission. Good. I'll leave it to you." \n"Be warriors of the group and for the group!" The two responded in unison.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405121=A rumor was circulating in the Zeus Group - never piss off agent Suzuki Ren; those who she didn't like would soon die in an "accident." Later, the rumor even got a name - the Curse of Suzuki. \n"There's no such thing as a curse. God knows what they did in the past. Right, Luna?" \n"Meow..." Suzuki scratched the black cat's chin, not bothering to clarify the rumors among her coworkers. \n"Ah! I knew Luna would be here!" Kelly tumbled through the window into Suzuki Ren's office in a second and picked up Luna, who was still meowing softly at Suzuki. "The mission was done, thanks to your intel. Who's the target this time?" \n"In fact, I didn't plan to handle 'em; those colleagues gossiping behind my back hindered my intel gathering mission, so I have to..." Suzuki let out a fake sigh, and handed over a list of the gossipers' names. "I see." Kelly leaped out from the window with her black cat and soon disappeared in the falling night.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405122=Raised in one of the most prestigious families, Galande was still able to access some precious resources even in doomsday. His family background, coupled with the fact that he never tasted the flavor of defeat in his life, made the young and arrogant Galande believed that he already had all he needed to shape the future of the doomed world. \n"You still have a long way to go, my son." Said his father, who found Galande a mentor, Scholar David. "From today on, David will show you more about combat philosophy." \n"A scholar? Did he fight a single battle? Don't expect me to learn anythin' from his empty talks." Galande didn't take the mentor seriously at first until he went through several defeats in David's class. \n"Combat is more than aimless attacking." \nInside a mirage space projected by a tiny celestial sphere, Galande was trapped for almost an hour. "Remember, enemies won't just stay put and wait for your attack." David's voice came from the distance, "Now focus. Try to locate me and attack on me."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405123="Trust me. My drones will take care of everything, okay? I don't need any partners, much less three clumsy big fellas." Penny stood between the three with a long face, peering at her overly tall new teammates. \n"Any mission from the Zeus Group shall be performed TO THE POINT." Victoria couldn't tell that what Penny said was merely a complaint, it stepped up and stopped in front of Penny like a wall, with a knife in its hand. \n"Heh. I didn't mean I refused to do the mission. Ah, when I can stop explaining such things to the robot." Penny stood on her tiptoes with her hands on her waist as if supporting her back, trying to make herself look taller in front of Victoria. Meanwhile, things weren't going well with Galande and Macklin on the other side. \n"Why do I have to work with this droopy-eyed guy? What will happen if you take off that stupid mask?" Macklin, twirling his pistol with one hand, appeared to be dissatisfied with Galande who arrested the attention of all ladies. \n"Only those who got no ability would stand there judging others all day long," replied Galande, who never appreciated the playboy lifestyle of Macklin. It seemed this mission was bound to be tricky and challenging.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405124=Galande's mother died on a mission not long after giving birth to him. Galande was only able to piece together what her mother was like from others' descriptions: tough and independent; an excellent commander. Just when Galande thought that was all he could know about his mother, a match with Victoria gave him some unexpected clues. \n"Victoria is a war machine developed by our Group. It's loaded with a combat chip containing data from all known battles. Fight it as an opponent in training and you'll grow real fast." David held the data panel in his hand to keep track of Galande's battles with Victoria. \nVictoria was one of the few robots with a female voice. One day, it struck Galande down over and over again in a cold and merciless manner, and said to him abruptly, "Fight, fight to the bitter end." \n"Who told you these words?" Those were the last words his mother left on her commander's certificate, the words that Galande repeated many times in his mind. \n"Some said that Victoria could be so highly autonomous because of its fusion with human minds," David muttered. \n"Please tell me more about it, please!" \n"I may not have access to that much info. If you wanna know more, try to be part of the management of Zeus Group."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405125=In Zeus Group's sparring room, Penny, who operated the drones, and Victoria were preparing for a simulated drill. \n"Are you ready, big steel fella? Remember, act quick, and don't get caught by the enemy." Penny checked with Victoria for the last time through her headset, while her fingers tapped rapidly on the remote control of the drones. Soon dozens of drones were activated in turn. \n"Combat module activated; ready to fight." Victoria's voice sounded calm and resolute as usual, as she pulled out the saber in her robotic arm and assumed a fighting pose. \nThe simulated drill began. \nPenny's drones were as agile as little birds, traveling through the air at high speeds, searching for the best angle of attack. Victoria, meanwhile, was as sturdy as a fortress, using her arm to intercept the enemies. \n"Victoria, on your left!" Penny monitored the situation and warned Victoria in time through the headset. \nWithout hesitation, Victoria swung her arm and hit the enemy. \n"Bravo!" The instructor spectating outside the field exclaimed, "Flawless teamwork. You broke the damage record again!" \n"Looks like the big fella isn't as clumsy as I thought. Let's work together again next time. We can break a lot more records, right?" Penny changed her mind about Victoria that day.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405126="My dear Qian, your fighting pose has been etched in my mind ever since the last battle we fought together. The moonlight is too lovely to be wasted tonight. Would you like to join me in a moonlight dinner?" \nQian Qian received another invite from Macklin. His message seemed quite sincere, but at the thought of playboy-like behaviors, Qian only found the words hypocritical. This time, Qian, who had been "harassed" many times by him, decided to give him a lesson. She appeared at the restaurant on time, but the weapon in her hand seemed unfit for the occasion. \n"Qian, I know you'll come." Macklin, who had never failed even once in any romantic relationship, said so confidently while sucking the cigar between his fingers and handing over a bouquet with another hand. "It took me days to get some fresh flowers, you know. But it's definitely worth it if it could make you happy." \n"Enough with your tricks. You might have fooled me if I didn't see someone else's lip prints on the petals." Qian sneered and cut the bouquet into two pathetic halves. "Now you see what you'll end up into if you send me one more stupid letter."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405127="Morning, Ren, any news on the record?" Every Thursday, Isaac would knock on the door of Agent Suzuki Ren's office to ask about the latest progress. \n"You know, it's hard to preserve something as fragile and useless as a record in the apocalypse." Ren shrugged her shoulder, pulled out a piece of paper, and handed it over. "Here are the coordinates of several previously existing music halls and auditoriums, but, honestly, I don't think you can find your record among the piles of debris there." \n"I see. Thanks anyway." Even if the hope was slim, Isaac still searched the places one by one. On the way back, he ran into Lunn, who ridiculed the disillusioned Isaac, "Dude, stop looking for the record. It's not even as useful as two loaves of bread. Why don't you work with me; I can get you more than a poor record, possibly a gramophone!" \n"I'm afraid I can't live on without music, especially that piece of music..." Every night when he closed his eyes, Isaac would hum the tune his wife had played for him. He decided to find the only record his wife had left behind no matter what.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405128=One day, Isaac and scholar David were having a discussion about music. \n"Classical music survived longer than us. It witnessed history and the elapse of time. An intangible treasure indeed." Isaac said to David. "I personally prefer the improvisation and creativity of jazz; you know, each performance is unique, like picking a random star in the vast universe." While saying so, David played his favorite jazz music with his celestial body player. The melodious sound arrested the attention of Roland, who was passing by. "Hmm... The tune sounds so familiar." Roland who pushed open the door sighed lightly, "The last time I heard this tune was sometime before the zombie apocalypse. Time flew by, but the melody remains the same." \n"That's exactly the charm of music." Isaac took out his collection of records, "We can enjoy the best quality of music with this record player." \n"Alright, alright. You took out your record player again." Roland shook his head. \n"Even before the apocalypse, seldom do people spend this much on music." David could not quite understand why Isaac was so passionate about music. Isaac gently stroked the strings of his violin and replied, "I'm just completing what she left uncompleted..."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405129=In the wilderness where zombies roamed everywhere and resources were scarce, the tribes were still able to thrive thanks to the protection of the Wildlings. \nHarman, chief of the tribe, guarded the tribe with an impenetrable shield; Marlen, the sharpshooter of the tribe, fought off enemies with outstanding shooting skills; Jessie, the healer of the tribe, healed the wounds of many people; Kin Ogawa, the wandering swordsman, defended the tribe with his silent blade amid the sands. \nLoong, who was new to the tribe, heard their legends from the dwellers, but never thought those were real stories. Until one day, he was trapped in the quicksand; he somehow thought about what others told him before, "Whenever you are in need of help, call the name of Wildlings. They'll always come to your rescue." \nHe began to use all the force he had to cry out for help. Minutes later, several Wildlings members did show up to his surprise.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405130=Many children born in the early days of the apocalypse were left behind in the wilderness by their parents for various reasons before they could feel any love in the doomed world. \nThat was what happened to poor Kaya and Marlen. Even after being brought back to the tribe by the chief, they stayed with each other all the time and never talked to others in the tribe. \nOne day, Marlen, who went out hunting, got injured while trying to protect Kaya. She refused to receive the treatment from the witch doctor because she was afraid that the herbal medicine of the tribe might not be safe to use. \n"Marlen, don't be afraid. The tribe is now your home, isn't it?" Jessie calmed down Marlen who appeared overly cautious. \n"If you don't mind, you can call me Mom." Although there was no bloodline bond between Jessie and Marlen, the latter somehow dropped her guard for the first time upon hearing the gentle voice of Jessie. The skillful bandaging techniques of Jessie made Marlen had a vague idea of what "mom" meant. On that day, Marlen and Kaya finally began to take the tribe as their home and started to feel its warmth.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405131=Loong, who practiced kung-fu and came from the East, set foot on this mystic land trying to study the unique training method of the Wildlings. \nWhen he arrived at the gate of the tribe, Irma was chopping wood with a thousand-pound axe that she lifted with only one hand. She wielded it with ease as if it were as light as a feather. \n"This must be the legendary power of the Wildlings!" Loong marveled at the scene. \n"Ha-ha, this is not somethin' worth marveling at. Our chief can even throw an iron anchor like a dart." Hearing the compliment, Irma showed the young man her muscles. \n"Is this unbelievable force what keeps the Wildlings Tribe growing and thriving?" Loong was still fascinated by the power. \n"The power is only used to safeguard the people in an emergency." Harman came forward and patted on the shoulder of Loong, "The tribe's prosperity is a result of the efforts of each and every one of our members." \n"Chief, could you train me into a fighter as powerful as them?" Looking at the Harman, who was known as the strongest shield of the tribe, Loong made his earnest request. \n"It takes time for you to master these skills, young man. Why not follow me and look around in the tribe? When you know more about the place, you can better understand the force." \n"No prob. Please show me more about the tribe!"</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405132=An abrupt sound of horn heralded that this was not going to be a peaceful day. The patrols of the tribe dashed in, reporting that the Zombie Queen was heading toward the tribe. \n"The Zombie Queen... Looks like we are gonna have a tough fight today," said Chief Harman. \n"Chief, we fear not the Zombie Queen. We'll join the fight to defend our tribe!" Marlen proposed to lead the warriors and join the fight, "We are not safe anywhere as long as the Zombie Queen is still around." \n"Alright. Now gather the warriors. We'll meet at the gate in two minutes!" \nHe asked the warriors to set some traps along the path the Zombie Queen would pass by, but failed to hold her back. Harman then took the lead and shielded the warriors with his anchor; not far away, Marlen aimed at the Zombie Queen's head with her crossbow, trying to distract her. \n"Darn it. The arrow is not hard enough to penetrate its head!" \n"Aim at its eyes instead!" Marlen, who was frustrated seeing her arrows fall onto the ground one after another, heard a quick reminder from a mysterious man. She then altered the angle of attack and pinned an arrow right on one eye of the Zombie Queen, who paused where it was instantly. \n"Thanks for the info! You are..."\n"Knock down the enemy first." Kin Ogawa had no time to introduce himself to Marlen. He drew his sword and joined the battle. Thanks to the sharp observation and timely reinforcement of Kin, the Zombie Queen was finally suppressed and beheaded. \n"Thanks for your help. May I know your..."\n"Kin. Kin Ogawa. No need to thank me. I'm just trying to protect the land we live on."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405133=By the time Kin Ogawa arrived at the lab which was claimed to be a place to study ores, he ran into someone else who was looking for the same place. Duncan who took the task of investigating the lab tried to stop Titan from getting into the lab through the front gate. \n"I need to save my people held inside! I won't thwart your investigation. And you'd better not get in the way!" \n"Huh, no way. The noise you make will obviously ruin my plan." Duncan would not let a stranger mess up his mission. \nThe two who failed to reach an agreement were about to have a fight. That was when a loud noise sounded from inside the lab, with the ground trembling slightly. \n"Somethin' happened!" Kin was the first to dash into the lab, followed closely by Duncan and Titan. By the time they got in, the place was already in a mess. Judging from the sleeping pods with human-shaped creatures inside and the blood-stained surgery bench, one could easily tell that someone was secretly conducting human experiments here. \n"What's goin' on? Where are the people you held here?" Titan grabbed a researcher who was trying to run away. \n"It's the experiment...no...the ores! Uh...the sub-subjects all rebelled! There! Inside there!" The researcher stuttered in fright while pointing to the door of a room, from which came the roar of an unknown creature. \n"Looks like we have the same enemy now. Put aside our fight; let's handle this thing first." Kin pointed his chin at the room, suggesting a cooperation. \n"Sure. For now." \n"Agreed."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405134=In the Wildlings Tribe, Jessie, the witch doctor, was working on an anti-poison potion. She failed many times due to the lack of a suitable herb to catalyze it. One day, she consulted Eva and Elaine, who also knew something about potions, and was inspired by their novel ideas. \n"Death is an inevitable process for every life. To make an anti-poison potion, you need to find something with extremely high toxicity tolerance." Elaine took Jessie to her herb garden and gave her some herbs that grew in the swamp. \n"These herbs are natural anti-poison ingredients. You know, a person needs to have a rest to recover from an injury, the herb can revitalize a person during the process." Eva took out the Seed of Life she had soaked in a potion, "Take the root of this herb as well. It'll trigger the best effect of the potion." \nOn her way back, Jessie pondered over their suggestions, weighing the pros and cons in her mind. Suddenly she had a bold idea. \nShe decided to blend the two herbs, mingling the forces of life and death. That's how she created a ground-breaking anti-poison potion that could slow down the spread of the toxin without harming one's body. Jessie's bold attempt also gave Eva and Elaine an inspiration. They realized that life and death perhaps were intertwined with each other in some inexplicable ways.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405135=In the doomsday, the zombie crisis haunted every corner of the world. Dwellers in the tribes lived a hard life for a long time until Buri, from the Vida Tribe, paid a visit one day with his messenger Eva and invited the major tribes to work together and unite their forces. \nBuri and Eva were the first to visit the Origna Tribe deep in the dense forest. The people there lived a self-sufficient life in an isolated world. \n"Chief, the dwellers of the Wildlings Tribe need help from your mighty warriors." \n"I see. The winds of the land tell me of the hardship you are going through. I have no reason to turn down such an earnest request." \nThe Chief of the Origna Tribe then sent his most powerful warrior, Ada, to help the Wildlings Tribe. Thanks to Ada's ability to locate targets through sound waves, they found a mysterious tribe called the Bone Tower Tribe. \n"The Wildlings are suffering for a long time. Those deceased were turned into painless monsters and are wandering around outside our tribe all day long. We know the Bone Tower Tribe knows the secret of death. Could you lend us a hand?" \n"Sure. It is our duty to handle the monsters that stained the souls of the deceased." The Bone Tower Tribe sent Elaine, who was skilled in spell casting. That was the first time the three major tribes worked together to face the crisis and challenges in the doomsday.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405136=Duncan the bounty hunter had been waiting outside the Sandy Tribe for days. His target this time was the heirloom jade pendant on Loong, who was receiving special training at the tribe. Someone had offered a bounty enough for Duncan to take a break for half a year. \n"Finally, you stepped out of the gate. If it's not to maintain good relations with the tribe, I would have sneaked in and ended your life days ago." With a cigarette in his mouth, Duncan loaded his gun and aimed it at Loong's head. \n"Watch out!" Kaya noticed Duncan's move and pulled her bow the second the bullet was shot. As a result, the bullet was hit by the arrow and was deflected. \n"Who's there?" Loong drew his nunchucks and looked in the direction the bullet came from. He spotted Duncan who was trying to run away after his failed mission. "Stay there if you got some guts!" \n"Huh. It's not over yet." Duncan soon dumped Loong based on his knowledge of the surrounding terrain, "A bounty hunter will never let his prey go. Next time, you might not be this lucky."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405137=In the Wildlings Tribe, strength was the ultimate measure of a warrior. Ada and Irma, who both fought with huge axes, were iconic representations of the tribe's strength. \n"Ada, I know how powerful your twin axes are. You know what? My thousand-pound axe is no weaker than yours. Wanna have a little sparring? What do you say?" Irma proposed the challenge as she rested the axe on her shoulder. \n"Strength is not only from the weapon we use but also from a tough mind. Sure, I'll take your challenge." Ada responded in a calm tone. \nThe two went to an open area, where members of the tribe gathered to cheer for them. Irma moved first; she slashed at Ada swiftly out of a sudden. Ada reacted quickly and crossed her axes to block the incoming blow. "Don't expect to defeat me with this little strength!" Ada shunned Irma back and chopped at her from both the left and right sides with her twin axes, forcing Irma to retreat to the edge of the field. \n"Alright, alright. I lost. Well done." Irma fell to the ground after being hit in the shoulder by the back of Ada's axe. \n"It matters not whether we win or lose. We should be proud of our strength as long as we can use it to safeguard our tribe." Ada reached out to Irma and helped her stand up. They had a fist bump and went away side by side.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405138=Resources were exceptionally precious in the Doomsday. Buri and Ada, as representatives of their respective tribes, often argued over resource distribution to get more for their own tribes. As a matter of fact, few knew that the two were close friends privately and often talked for hours over drinks in the bar. \n"Your tribe snatched the largest share of ores today, huh?" Buri filled up the cup for Ada and patted her shoulder with the other hand, "You'll never back down on the resource thing even once." \n"Sorry 'bout that. But our warriors are in urgent need of ores to have their weapons repaired. I had no choice." Ada raised her cup and drank it up, "But I don't promise I'll give in next time." \n"Ha-ha. I didn't expect to buy you with just a drink. To our health!" Buri raised his cup and took a gulp. When he put it down, he suddenly put on a serious look, "But next time, I won't let you get one more share of herbs." \n"We'll see."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">405139=In order to save a child caught by a zombie, Kin Ogawa was scratched by the zombie accidentally. He saw the crimson blood coming out of his wound; the next second, he felt an overwhelming dizziness and struggled toughly to get back to his tribe. \n"Urgh...I can't...can't stop here. My sis-sister was still..."\n"Wait! Who are you? This is the territory of the Bone Tower Tribe." Elaine stopped Kin with her scythe. Before she could ask for his identity, he fainted as a result of zombie toxins. \n"Got bitten by zombies?" \n"Save him, please! He got bitten when trying to save me." The child who was still held tightly in Kin's arms, cried for help. \n"The toxin is now all over his body. We need to scratch the toxin from his bones to stop it from spreading. It's gonna be painful, and...may not be successful." Though moved by the poor child, Elaine was still unsure whether it was a wise choice to get involved in the tricky matter. \n"Just go ahead.

What is Energy Value? \nEnergy Value determines how many weapons, armor, and accessories you can install in a vehicle. When the energy consumption exceeds the vehicle's upper energy limit, all parts loaded will cease to operate. \n2. How to increase Energy Value? \nYou can upgrade the vehicle's engine to increase its Energy Value. \n3. What do the attributes of the vehicle apply to? \nAll Heroes in the vehicle Lineup. \n4. How are the skills cast by a vehicle settled in a battle? \nA vehicle's basic attributes in a battle are decided by the Heroes' attributes in the Lineup and the number of soldiers. The more powerful the Heroes and the more soldiers you have in the team, the more effective the skills the vehicle can cast. \n5. In what gameplay do the modifications of a vehicle take effect? \nWorld, Arena, Infinity Arena, and Champion Duel. \n6. Can a vehicle be used by multiple Lineups? \nNo. Currently, one vehicle can only be used by one Lineup. \n7. Can you get multiple APCs of the same type? \nNo. Currently, you can only get one of each type of APC. \n8. Can an upgraded part be reverted? \nNo. Currently, you cannot revert an upgraded part, so please proceed with caution. \n9. Why can't I modify my vehicle? \nDuring S0 and S1, you cannot modify your vehicle, and there is no Energy Value. You can only do the modification when S2 begins. \n10. Where can I get the parts for APC modification? \nDuring S2, you can get them from Infinity Arena, Desperado Shop, and other events. \n11. I repaired all the vehicles. What should I do with the rest of the Chariot Components? \nMore vehicles will be coming in the future that also consume Chariot Components, so please stay tuned. \n12. Why are all my Heroes level 100 in Infinity Arena? \nIn Infinity Arena, all your heroes will be temporarily set to level 100.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">460147=Large Load</div><div class="diff-line ctx">460148=Large Load (S)</div><div class="diff-line ctx">460149=Part info</div><div class="diff-line ctx">460150=Vehicle info</div><div class="diff-line ctx">460151=Buffs</div><div class="diff-line ctx">460152=No vehicle</div><div class="diff-line ctx">460153=No skills</div><div class="diff-line ctx">460154=New World Protector</div><div class="diff-line ctx">460155=Energy Catching Device</div><div class="diff-line ctx">460156=Energy Catcher</div><div class="diff-line ctx">460157=Creates 1 energy barrier in each round for a random hero in your Lineup, reducing damage taken from enemies' next attack by {0}.

We had to embark on a new journey, exploring an unknown world once again. Like before, the poisonous gas and ores were still everywhere as our eyes could see. Yet, the terrain seemed to be quite different.\nWhat is the relationship between Eden, the portal, and the different worlds we were transferred to? We need to do something to settle down first. Maybe we could start with occupying some Blocks and collecting ores.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">600062=Vanguard Diary (New World)\nThe environment of the new world was worse than we expected. The most daunting threat would be those Zombies who were getting even more powerful. Luckily, our researchers already completed the design of a variety of Facilities. With these Facilities, the strength of the soldiers was significantly enhanced. It's time to cleanse the Zombies again.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">600063=Vanguard Diary (New World)\nTo get to the other side of the mountain range, the troops began to march toward the cities in the valley. As we explored more cities, the troops found some traces of human activities in the cities.\nThat is to say, there still were some other survivors apart from us? This info made everyone feel uneasy. Are they friends or foes? We need to figure it out.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">600064=Vanguard Diary (New World)\nThe discovery of the traces of strangers made us more alert. Where did they come from? What did they want? Are there any other portals in other worlds? There are more questions than answers at the moment. The only thing we know is to occupy Eden before others do. That might be the only way to find the answer.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">600065=Vanguard Diary (New World)\nWitnessing the world falling apart little by little, we operated the portal to get ready for the teleport. As was shown on the monitor of the portal, there really were other survivors who were heading to the same destination as us. This time, we come prepared and have nothing to fear. We will take the lead and see what we can do in the new world.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">600066=Vanguard Diary (New World) -- Day 2\nWe began our exploration of the new world with great caution. Soon, we noticed the abandoned Doomsday Laboratory. To our surprise, there were many extremely advanced precision instruments and apparatus. Who left this Facility here? With all these doubts on our minds, we decided to cleanse the Zombies in the lab first.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">600067=Vanguard Diary (New World) -- Day 3\nThrough the control panel in the lab, we found that the lab was closely related to the cities in the world. From the lab, we could remotely activate the defense system in those cities to improve their attributes.\nThis will no doubt boost our power and help us conquer Eden. For this reason, it's quite important to be the first to occupy the Doomsday Laboratory.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">600068=Vanguard Diary (New World) -- Day 4\nWith the help of the Doomsday Laboratory, the troops broke into the inner ring and moved toward Eden. Around Eden, the troops found many meandering rivers and streams, looking like cracks in the earth. This scene reminded us of the dreadful moment when the old world was about to be devoured by that great rift.\nThe ground of the new world looked increasingly similar to the world eroded by the dark rift.
