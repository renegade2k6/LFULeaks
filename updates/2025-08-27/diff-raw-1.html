Amid the cheers, she handed the Sash of Courage she won to the girl in second place. The inconspicuous young lady with a bashful smile won second place, which surprised everyone. Yet Natalie knew she deserved it. She often saw her practicing for hours at the shooting range. "The extra miles you went deserve the honor. We'll count on the next-gen sharpshooters like you to protect our fortress."</div><div class="diff-line add">803015143=In a scouting mission, Brady stumbled upon an intact ribbon on a rotten zombie. The ribbon was so clean and unwrinkled. Its previous owner must have cherished it in the best way she could. \n"The ribbon must have meant something to her before she turned a zombie," Brady murmured, hit by a wave of sadness. \nBe it a festive ornament or a gift from the family, behind every little present was a warm memory from the past. Brady picked up the ribbon, and later embellished it with fabric and a metal plate to turn it into a decent medal. It was now displayed on the medal wall. \n"With the hopes and remorse of the deceased, we shall live on no matter what."</div><div class="diff-line add">803015146=Roaming Knight</div><div class="diff-line add">803015147=There he is roaming across the wasteland.

As Brady was evacuating residents, N.A.T.E. dashed into the blaze with a fire extinguisher in its claw, and started to put out the fire at targeted spots. Flames and smoke charred his body and overheated many of the components inside. By the time the fire was finally extinguished, he only managed to send out a short message, "Mission complete. Zero casualties," before entering an error-caused "hibernation." After days of repair work, technicians brought N.A.T.E. "back to life", whose "eyes" appeared again on the monitor.

The Fortress was never short of threats and crises. This time, it was the power system, which was wrecked by a bunch of mutated zombies. People had to figure out a plan in sheer darkness. Pulling themselves together from the accident, they soon broke into their roles: Natalie led the patrol team to fight off zombies; N.A.T.E. worked to put the power back on; Brady cleared the path in place of the patrol; Emma helped in the medical tent; Fernando, on the other hand, sang an off-key cadence while trying to distract zombies and threw a handmade flash grenade at them to buy more time.

Missions taken by a member cannot be taken by the others. There will be a time limit on a mission. The mission will be considered a failure if not completed within the given time. \n3. There are alliance missions and exclusive missions. Exclusive missions can only be taken by you. Alliance missions are open to all. You can take up to 6 missions (alliance and exclusive ones in total) for free every day. The attempts for taking missions will be updated daily. You can also spend Diamonds to purchase 4 additional attempts to take missions. \n4. R5 and R4s can refresh alliance missions.
