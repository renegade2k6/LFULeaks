Here, we solemnly declare that these are all false and misleading info. Commanders must not be deceived by these illegal offers, as these offers will often result in the loss of in-game assets.\n\nTo maintain order in the wasteland, ensure the interests of Commanders and the security of account info, authorities will henceforth crack down on and punish illegal activities such as third-party transactions and trades severely, including but not limited to:\n1. Accounts that already had transactions made by a third party will have all items and currency involved in the transactions removed. If remaining items are insufficient, Diamonds will be deducted instead (amount equivalent to the items' value)\n2. Accounts with heavy use of third-party transactions will face punishments ranging from temporary bans to permanent bans.\n3. Problems arising from illegal transactions and other related situations are not eligible for compensation.\n4. If losses are incurred from using third-party transaction platform, please resort to after-sales rights protection on the third-party transaction platform\n5. If an account is stolen due to aforementioned third-party transactions, account trading and other illegal activities, the account will not be eligible for recovery.\nIn addition, to ensure the safety of each Commander's personal assets and info, we solemnly remind you that transactions through third-party platforms are not protected and extremely risky\n1. Transactions through these channels have no safety guarantee. Stolen accounts and in-game asset losses are common occurrences for players who use these third-party platforms\n2. Third-party platforms may also steal player account info, or worse, personal identifications. Such info can further cause severe consequences.\n3.
