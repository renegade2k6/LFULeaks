Please select another alliance to declare war.</div><div class="diff-line add">610081=This alliance already has an opponent, so you cannot respond to its war declaration.</div><div class="diff-line add">610082=Your alliance already has an opponent. You can't declare any other war.</div><div class="diff-line add">610083=Unable to declare war during the tally</div><div class="diff-line add">610084=You have already declared war on this alliance.

The war lasts 4 hours. When the war begins, the system will randomly select a city in the territory of both sides as the spawn point. Commanders can relocate the fortresses to the spawn city. If the opponent has no cities, the attacker can move to any map location.\n2. The attacker can go back to near the Main Alliance City directly through the event page.\n3. The attacker can only (temporarily) occupy the opponent's spawn city before any other city. After the city is occupied, it will enter a protection state and temporarily belong to the attacker.\n4. After the war starts, both alliances can not change the Main City or give up any city.\n5. After the war ends, all invading commanders can directly return to near their Main Alliance City. All invading commanders will automatically return to their Zones at the end of Warring Day.\n6. If the opponent does not have enough cities or Main Alliance City, the attacker can get the corresponding bonus and points directly.\n7. If the alliances are in the same Zone, the cities in the protection state will be returned at the end of the event.\n8. During the war, Eden can only be attacked by the adjacent alliance, not the opponent in Alliance Duel. The battle rules for Eden remain unchanged.\n9. During the war, you can get points by killing/grievously wounding the enemy soldiers, destroying the enemy facilities, and occupying the enemy cities:\nKilling/wounding a Lv. 1 soldier gets 1 point.\nKilling/wounding a Lv. 2 soldier gets 2 points.\nKilling/wounding a Lv. 3 soldier gets 3 points.\nKilling/wounding a Lv. 4 soldier gets 5 points.\nKilling/wounding a Lv. 5 soldier gets 7 points.\nKilling/wounding a Lv. 6 soldier gets 10 points.\nKilling/wounding a Lv. 7 soldier gets 15 points.\nKilling/wounding a Lv. 8 soldier gets 20 points.\nKilling/wounding a Lv. 9 soldier gets 30 points.\nKilling/wounding a Lv. 10 soldier gets 40 points.\nDecreasing the enemy's Facility Durability by 1 point gets 3 points.\nOccupying the enemy's main city gets 50,000,000 points.\n10. If the two sides have the same points, the side that declares the war wins.</div><div class="diff-line add">610088=The rewards are determined by the tier and ranking of your Alliance and will be delivered to you via mail upon the tally.</div><div class="diff-line add">610089=Dear Commander, congratulations to your alliance on winning this week's Alliance Duel!

Don't worry about the light. An excellent circuit engineer can take care of it in no time!</div><div class="diff-line add">700009=Who are you? And why are you here?</div><div class="diff-line add">700010=Guess that explains the footsteps.</div><div class="diff-line add">700011=So this is how you treat the person who just saved you?</div><div class="diff-line add">700012=Don't get me wrong. We just wanted to know who you are. After all, you can't be too careful in a post-apocalyptic world.</div><div class="diff-line add">700013=...Chihiro Fujiwara. I'd be long gone had I not lost track of my brother in a zombie mess.</div><div class="diff-line add">700014=I'm not here to make friends. You're welcome to stay here if you don't trust me.</div><div class="diff-line add">700015=...Let's just play along.

I wonder where it leads.</div><div class="diff-line add">700018=That's the Fortress entrance. Let's hope the facilities underground still work...</div><div class="diff-line add">700019=Ehm... She seems familiar with this place.</div><div class="diff-line add">700020=That's good. She can be our guide.</div><div class="diff-line add">700021=What's that?</div><div class="diff-line add">700022=A notebook... There might be something in it that can help me find my brother.</div><div class="diff-line add">700023=That'd be good, but I hope we can find something useful about the Fortress.</div><div class="diff-line add">700024=Forget about the notebook. I just wanna take a nap!</div><div class="diff-line add">700025=Alright. Guess we all had a rough day... Let's get some rest for now.</div><div class="diff-line add">700026=You guys go ahead. I'm gonna flip through the notebook.</div><div class="diff-line add">700027=Hey, has anyone seen Chihiro?</div><div class="diff-line add">700028=Her diary is just lying open on the desk. She must have found something in that notebook and took a leave hastily.</div><div class="diff-line add">700029=I was just gone for a few days. Guess it's up to me to save the day again.</div><div class="diff-line add">700030=Ahem... It's just a little hiccup... How's things with you? Found your brother yet?</div><div class="diff-line add">700031=I was trying to reach the Control Center through a hidden tunnel, but things didn't go as planned. The tunnel collapsed.</div><div class="diff-line add">700032=Hope the device still works... Based on what my brother taught me... If I remember correctly... There you go...</div><div class="diff-line add">700033=Then...enter the command...access the Fortress's security cameras... Searching for clues about my brother...</div><div class="diff-line add">700034=You really know what you're doing.</div><div class="diff-line add">700035=It's hard not to when you spend your entire childhood in this place...</div><div class="diff-line add">700036=*Radio static* ...Why are you doing this?! ...You... You'll destroy the whole Fortress!</div><div class="diff-line add">700037=It's my brother!</div><div class="diff-line add">700038=I'm sorry, Mr. Kin Ogawa. I have my reason...

Aah...</div><div class="diff-line add">700040=Watchers... Sorry guys, I gotta go. We'll meet again if fate permits!</div><div class="diff-line add">700041=Watchers? Aren't they the human's biggest hope of finding a cure? How could they...</div><div class="diff-line add">700042=Enough, that's not our problem. Let's focus here.</div><div class="diff-line add">700043=I hate to admit you're right, but sometimes, you just seem cold-blooded when you play cool.</div><div class="diff-line add">700044=I'll take it as a compliment. This is how you survive in a post-apocalyptic world.</div><div class="diff-line add">700045=Bingo!</div><div class="diff-line add">700046=A recording named after our countersign! He was here! What happened, though? He didn't even say goodbye.</div><div class="diff-line add">700047=A &lt;color=#ae6e55&gt;Work Station&lt;/color&gt; was unlocked on the upper right side of the Control Center.</div><div class="diff-line add">700048=启动了雷达代表我们已经向外界公布了自己的坐标。</div><div class="diff-line add">700049=可是单凭你和我，想要守护避难所恐怕很难。</div><div class="diff-line add">700050=别担心，我们可以在大世界上寻找更多合作伙伴。我已经联系了我的老朋友。</div><div class="diff-line add">700051=发现雷达信号！</div><div class="diff-line add">700052=…喂！有人能收到吗？我是义勇军藤原千寻，我发现了幸存者信号！请求援助！</div><div class="diff-line add">700053=雷达探测到了目标位置。</div><div class="diff-line add">700054=通过卫星地图，我们能观测到地面世界的一举一动，从而锁定目标位置。</div><div class="diff-line add">700055=太好了，来看看她在什么地方吧！</div><div class="diff-line add">700056=哇哦，我看到我们的避难所了。</div><div class="diff-line add">700057=目标也锁定了，准备出发吧。</div><div class="diff-line add">700058=千寻！欢迎你回到避难所，哈哈，你还好吗？</div><div class="diff-line add">700059=没时间寒暄了，我找到了我哥哥小川剑的坐标，他现在的处境很危险！</div><div class="diff-line add">700060=各位，可以陪我走一趟吗？位置已经同步到你们的雷达上了。</div><div class="diff-line add">700061=雷达位置已锁定。</div><div class="diff-line add">700062=唔……只凭我们真的没问题吗？他们似乎有很多&lt;color=#ae6e55&gt;士兵&lt;/color&gt;。</div><div class="diff-line add">700063=不用担心，我刚从义勇军接受救援任务时，可是听到不少有关娜塔莉、前、辈的故事。</div><div class="diff-line add">700064=她曾经可是义勇军首屈一指的神秘特工，就是不知道为什么离开了义勇军。</div><div class="diff-line add">700065=……这跟我们的救援无关。既然确定了方位，就赶紧行动。</div><div class="diff-line add">700066=哥哥！是我啊！千寻！</div><div class="diff-line add">700067=千寻…咳咳…对不起，哥哥没能遵守约定，在避难所和你汇合。</div><div class="diff-line add">700068=才不是！是千寻太弱了！</div><div class="diff-line add">700069=我们现在的实力还无法跟他们对抗，冒然行事只会暴露我们自己。</div><div class="diff-line add">700070=……我想，我知道一些讯息。</div><div class="diff-line add">700071=这是当年我在守望集团任职时所看管实验室的坐标。</div><div class="diff-line add">700072=没想到你居然在守望集团任职过，难怪之前在中控室听到录音后你那么安静。</div><div class="diff-line add">700073=这都是过去的事了。</div><div class="diff-line add">700074=算了，不说这些。还是先去实验室一探究竟吧。</div><div class="diff-line add">700075=重逢的兄妹</div><div class="diff-line add">700076=神秘的过往</div><div class="diff-line add">700077=交织的线索</div><div class="diff-line add">700078=谁是黛安娜</div><div class="diff-line add">700080=好在千寻如愿找到了她的哥哥，不过处境危险，我们要小心一点。</div><div class="diff-line add">700081=随着调查深入，我们发现了越来越多跟当前各组织相关的过往，末日当头，乱世我们将如何自处……</div><div class="diff-line add">700082=原来各位到避难所来都有各自的目的，避难所究竟有着怎样的曾经？只有抽丝剥茧才能接近真相</div><div class="diff-line add">700083=费尔南德前几天捡到一个微型通讯器后就魂不守舍，这位黛安娜到底是什么来历，我们得好好调查一下了。</div><div class="diff-line add">700085=千寻的回归</div><div class="diff-line add">700086=收到了藤原千寻的信号，原来她是义勇军的人！不过，看起来她好像需要我们帮助！</div><div class="diff-line add">700087=Recording A</div><div class="diff-line add">700088=Recording B</div><div class="diff-line add">700089=？？？</div><div class="diff-line add">700090=I'll look around for her. And you guys...</div><div class="diff-line add">700091=If only I knew you guys had cleared a way to the Control Center. Gotta say, good work.</div><div class="diff-line add">700092=Rest assured. We Watchers always take care of our friends.</div><div class="diff-line add">700093=We must first repair the &lt;color=#ae6e55&gt;Control Center&lt;/color&gt; before unlocking more facilities to survive in this world...</div><div class="diff-line add">700100=Radar signal detected!</div><div class="diff-line add">700101=…Hey! Is anyone there? I am Rebecca of the Minutemen. I picked up signals from other survivors. Requesting help!</div><div class="diff-line add">700102=It's Rebecca! She's an old friend.</div><div class="diff-line add">700103=The radar has picked up the target's location.</div><div class="diff-line add">700104=Everybody. This is Rebecca. We go way back.</div><div class="diff-line add">700105=A deadeye sniper of the Minutemen like her can drop any enemy she scopes.</div><div class="diff-line add">700106=Rebecca, I'd like you to meet my Fortress comrades. Brady, Emma, and Fernando.</div><div class="diff-line add">700107=Great to meet you all! I'd love to get to know you guys when we have the time.</div><div class="diff-line add">700108=It's been a long time. I see you still got the skills!</div><div class="diff-line add">700109=You're not so bad yourself.</div><div class="diff-line add">700110=I'm glad to see you've made new friends.</div><div class="diff-line add">700111=Things might turn out differently if I had been there when you left the Minutemen...</div><div class="diff-line add">700112=Enough about that. Look at the Fortress we built.</div><div class="diff-line add">700113=Instead of dwelling on the past, I want to improve the future.</div><div class="diff-line add">700114=Then at least let me help you this time!</div><div class="diff-line add">700115=Great! With these drawings, we can improve the Fortress even further! Way to go!</div><div class="diff-line add">700116=But, Rebecca, this is the Minutemen's intel. Are you sure you want me to have it?</div><div class="diff-line add">700117=It's okay. You deserve it since you helped me rescue the survivors. Besides, we're all on their side!</div><div class="diff-line add">700118=I can't believe Natalie was one of the Minutemen! She's full of surprises!</div><div class="diff-line add">700119=No wonder Natalie got this sense of discretion on her. That deadly composure when it comes to killing zombies.</div><div class="diff-line add">700120=Why did you leave, though, Natalie?</div><div class="diff-line add">700121=It's a long story...</div><div class="diff-line add">700122=She didn't tell you? Natalie was the best female agent of the Minutemen! Also...</div><div class="diff-line add">700123=Maybe another time. Let's see if there are any distress calls from other survivors!</div><div class="diff-line add">700124=Intel from the Minutemen suggests an urgent distress signal nearby.</div><div class="diff-line add">700125=It's from some geologist in desperate need of our help!</div><div class="diff-line add">700126=The target is located in a hazardous area. We can't handle this by ourselves.</div><div class="diff-line add">700127=Crap, they got away!</div><div class="diff-line add">700128=Molotov from the Vindicators... There's their signature!</div><div class="diff-line add">700129=No doubt the Vindicators have our geologist. They're notorious for their crookedness. We must find them fast.</div><div class="diff-line add">700130=Who is this geologist, anyway? He's sure getting all the attention from both parties.</div><div class="diff-line add">700131=I've sent a request to the Minutemen. They'll give us more information.</div><div class="diff-line add">700132=According to the intel, the victim's name is Diana. Her father is a famous architect.</div><div class="diff-line add">700133=Diana is an outstanding specialist in her own work despite her father's fame.</div><div class="diff-line add">700134=An outstanding geologist? We need such an expert while the Fortress construction is in full swing!</div><div class="diff-line add">700135=You're right. We must do all we can to bring her back safely.</div><div class="diff-line add">700136=Ready? We must not waste any time!</div><div class="diff-line add">700137=You're safe, Diana. Now that we got you out, the Fortress will protect you.</div><div class="diff-line add">700138=Thank god! I couldn't take it anymore... Those Vindicators... They're a bunch of lunatics!</div><div class="diff-line add">700139=Anyway, you have my eternal gratitude! I'll do whatever I can to repay your kindness!</div><div class="diff-line add">700140=It's okay, Diana. People at the Fortress are all nice and friendly. No more Vindicators.</div><div class="diff-line add">700141=About the Vindicators... Natalie, how's your investigation going?</div><div class="diff-line add">700142=You mean the truth behind me being framed as a traitor?</div><div class="diff-line add">700143=Someone set you up and said you were a traitor using a photo of you and the Vindicators, right?</div><div class="diff-line add">700144=Holy moly! That happened to you, Natalie?!</div><div class="diff-line add">700145=Yes, that's why I came to the Fortress, to find proof to clear my name.</div><div class="diff-line add">700147=Old Friend</div><div class="diff-line add">700148=The Once Minuteman</div><div class="diff-line add">700149=Full of Surprises</div><div class="diff-line add">700150=Distress Signal</div><div class="diff-line add">700151=The Geologist</div><div class="diff-line add">700152=The radar is repaired, which means our coordinates are also in the open. We must stay alert for more threats coming our way.</div><div class="diff-line add">700153=Rebecca, an old friend of Natalie, brought help from the Minutemen. Our success in rescuing the victim is further guaranteed.</div><div class="diff-line add">700154=So Natalie was once a Minuteman. No wonder she is highly skilled. Things just get more and more interesting.</div><div class="diff-line add">700155=We picked up an urgent distress call. An emergency like this requires all the help we can get!</div><div class="diff-line add">700156=A mysterious geologist sent a distress signal in a desperate situation. We must rescue the victim from the Vindicators fast!</div><div class="diff-line add">700157=She found the survivor. We should trace the location through her signal.</div><div class="diff-line add">700158=Remember that building I was trapped in when I was investigating the survivors' gathering place?</div><div class="diff-line add">700159=Using the Fortress radar, I picked up a distress signal not far from there. I must go rescue the survivors first.</div><div class="diff-line add">700160=Let's not waste any time, then. We can catch up later after the rescue!</div><div class="diff-line add">700161=I know a military base abandoned by the Minutemen, where we can find drawings to build a &lt;color=#ae6e55&gt;Soldier Training Camp&lt;/color&gt;.</div><div class="diff-line add">700162=I've uploaded the coordinates to the radar.</div><div class="diff-line add">700300=Seek help</div><div class="diff-line add">700301=Support (Official)</div><div class="diff-line add">700302=Default language</div><div class="diff-line add">700303=Contact Game Mod</div><div class="diff-line add">700304=Become a Game Mod</div><div class="diff-line add">700305=Note: Game Mods are also common players.

An excellent circuit engineer will fix it in no time!</div><div class="diff-line add">701013=没想到实验室已被丧尸攻陷了，看来当年的丑闻并未让守望集团放弃研究。</div><div class="diff-line add">701014=看看这些破碎的生物罐和畸形的怪物，看来守望集团的“杰作”还不少。</div><div class="diff-line add">701015=额……那是刚刚攻击我们的丧尸吗，天哪，它为什么会有四只手臂，好恶心。等等……</div><div class="diff-line add">701016=瞧它手臂上的眼睛纹身，单眼、紫色、重瞳，天呐，它之前的身份是……</div><div class="diff-line add">701017=荒野之子的祭祀！</div><div class="diff-line add">701018=等等，你怎么会知道我们部落的图腾信息。</div><div class="diff-line add">701019=我曾是名周转于荒野之子各部落的记者。</div><div class="diff-line add">701020=记者……我好像听巫医提起过。</div><div class="diff-line add">701021=因为我看到避难所研究出丧尸血清的新闻，过于兴奋连夜前往这里。</div><div class="diff-line add">701022=丧尸疫苗的新闻？哦！我也是看到那个报道过来的。</div><div class="diff-line add">701023=不过看避难所早已荒废的情况，所谓的丧尸疫苗恐怕只是避难所吸引幸存者的噱头罢了。</div><div class="diff-line add">701024=不，那并不是骗人的假信息。</div><div class="diff-line add">701025=难道……</div><div class="diff-line add">701026=避难所在博士的带领下确实研究出一款血清，成功治愈了刚被丧尸感染的患者。</div><div class="diff-line add">701027=但不幸的是消息遭人泄露，为抢夺丧尸血清各大势力对避难所发起围攻，避难所很快就被攻破了……</div><div class="diff-line add">701028=怀璧其罪，更何况现在还是末日。</div><div class="diff-line add">701029=你还有那位博士的线索吗？</div><div class="diff-line add">701030=从守望集团逃出后我也一直在寻找博士的线索。我知道避难所另一个的逃生出口的坐标，或许那有线索。</div><div class="diff-line add">701031=那还等什么，赶紧出发吧。</div><div class="diff-line add">701032=唔……我还是第一次见娜塔莉那么积极。</div><div class="diff-line add">701033=该死，这里根本什么都没有。</div><div class="diff-line add">701034=还是头回见到你失去方寸，那位避难所的博士是你什么重要的人吗？</div><div class="diff-line add">701035=确实是很重要的……人。</div><div class="diff-line add">701036=之前有提到过我从义勇军离开的事情。原因是我被人诬陷是来自复仇者的间谍……</div><div class="diff-line add">701037=他们的证据是一张我跟复仇者前首领的合照，但我清楚，合照上应该还有其他的人。</div><div class="diff-line add">701038=你是说合照上也有博士吗？但在我所知道的情报里，博士从未离开避难所。</div><div class="diff-line add">701039=没错，所以我才会返回避难所，想要寻找那张照片的真实版本。</div><div class="diff-line add">701040=费尔南德，你一直鬼鬼祟祟的在那边干什么呢？话也不说一句。</div><div class="diff-line add">701041=没，没什么……啊，别抢，那是我捡到的通讯器。</div><div class="diff-line add">701042=布雷迪，你有没有发现费尔南德最近好奇怪。饭也不吃了，成天躲在房间里研究他捡到的通讯器。</div><div class="diff-line add">701043=看来，里面一定还有什么我不知道的，或许你可以去问问。</div><div class="diff-line add">701044=我才不要呢，谁管他！他不吃，还省了我做饭的功夫呢！</div><div class="diff-line add">701045=布雷迪，布雷迪！谢天谢地，我终于破解通讯器里的坐标了，我们快去找黛安娜吧！</div><div class="diff-line add">701046=什么坐标，还有……黛安娜又是谁？</div><div class="diff-line add">701047=额……我的一位……朋友。</div><div class="diff-line add">701048=哦~朋、友啊。</div><div class="diff-line add">701049=复仇者的方巾……还有标志性的喷漆。</div><div class="diff-line add">701050=刚才他们绑走的是谁？</div><div class="diff-line add">701051=我们还是来晚了……我真是……我该死！</div><div class="diff-line add">701052=费尔南德？你怎么？哭了……</div><div class="diff-line add">701053=他们绑走的是我的一个故人，她叫黛安娜。她的父亲是位知名的建造家.</div><div class="diff-line add">701054=她……当年因为我愚蠢的英雄主义而分手。</div><div class="diff-line add">701055=震惊，费尔南德居然有前女友。</div><div class="diff-line add">701056=爱玛！不是说这些的时候。</div><div class="diff-line add">701057=你们是怎么联系的？</div><div class="diff-line add">701058=用之前捡到的小型通讯器……不过，这通讯器的芯片不见了，似乎是被黛安娜拿走了？</div><div class="diff-line add">701059=娜塔莉！快！试试看能不能锁定黛安娜的位置！</div><div class="diff-line add">701061=是她！不知道她是否已经如愿找到了她的哥哥…马上锁定位置，准备出发！</div><div class="diff-line add">701062=太好了，我们快点去找千寻！来看看她在什么地方吧！</div><div class="diff-line add">701063=当务之急，是收集有关他们作恶的证据。</div><div class="diff-line add">701064=当初守望集团爆出人体实验的丑闻后，我跟很多同事都选择离开。原以为集团会做出改变，现在看来……</div><div class="diff-line add">701065=在研究部落的社会关系和语言体系过程中，跟这些神秘的族民结下深厚友谊。</div><div class="diff-line add">701066=当年听她提起过，她跟父亲被请去设计一个军用科研地下基地，之后就再没听过他们的消息。</div><div class="diff-line add">701067=她再次联系我，约我到避难所见面，一定是有重要的事情。</div><div class="diff-line add">701068=可我……却没能救她……</div><div class="diff-line add">701069=没想到半路遇到尸潮。</div><div class="diff-line add">701070=你一直在研究巫医药粉抑制丧尸病毒的可能性。</div><div class="diff-line add">701071=有天却不告而别。</div><div class="diff-line add">701072=是录音里自称守望集团的家伙伤害的你吗，我一定要让他们付出代价！</div><div class="diff-line add">701073=目前当务之急是赶紧增强我们的实力！</div><div class="diff-line add">710000=Distress signal detected!</div><div class="diff-line add">710001=…Hey! Is anyone there? I am Chihiro of the Minutemen. I picked up signals from other survivors. Requesting help!</div><div class="diff-line add">710002=It's her! I wonder if she has found her brother... Locate the position. We're moving now!</div><div class="diff-line add">710003=The radar has detected the location of the target.</div><div class="diff-line add">710004=We can monitor everything on the ground through satellite maps, thereby locking the target location.</div><div class="diff-line add">710005=That's great! Time to get Chihiro! Let's see where she is.</div><div class="diff-line add">710006=Wow, I can see the Fortress!</div><div class="diff-line add">710007=Destination locked! Let's go.</div><div class="diff-line add">710008=Time to do some exercise after hiding underground for this long!</div><div class="diff-line add">710009=Chihiro! Welcome back! How are you doing?</div><div class="diff-line add">710010=No time for small talk. I've found the coordinates of my brother. He seems to be in great danger!</div><div class="diff-line add">710011=Guys, can you accompany me on a trip? The position has been synchronized to your radar.</div><div class="diff-line add">710012=He's not here?! Why! There must be something we missed!</div><div class="diff-line add">710013=Don't worry, Chihiro. I'm sure your brother is okay. Natalie is good at tracking. She'll help you find him.</div><div class="diff-line add">710014=...I checked the gunshot wounds. They were here half an hour ago.</div><div class="diff-line add">710015=In other words, the attackers have not gone far. We can still chase them down! Let's...</div><div class="diff-line add">710016=Why should I believe you?! The last time I checked with the other Minutemen, they said something about you being a traitor!</div><div class="diff-line add">710017=What? Natalie was one of the Minutemen?</div><div class="diff-line add">710018=Traitor...?</div><div class="diff-line add">710019=She left because we got intel showing she's a spy from Vindicators! Give me one reason why I should trust her!</div><div class="diff-line add">710020=That "intel" was just another conspiracy. We still got a chance to find your brother now. Follow me if you will.</div><div class="diff-line add">710021=...I swear to God if you try something funny...</div><div class="diff-line add">710022=So here we are, where Chihiro's brother should be, according to the coordinates.</div><div class="diff-line add">710023=Are you sure? Don't even try to fool me.</div><div class="diff-line add">710024=I believe Natalie.</div><div class="diff-line add">710025=So do I. She had no reason to trick you. I don't think you two ever crossed paths, right?</div><div class="diff-line add">710026=But she... Never mind. Sorry about that. Let's move!</div><div class="diff-line add">710027=It's me! Chihiro!</div><div class="diff-line add">710028=Chihiro! I'm sorry I couldn't make it to the Fortress!</div><div class="diff-line add">710029=It was my fault! I was too weak and late.</div><div class="diff-line add">710030=It's okay now. We're here. Though, I won't be staying.</div><div class="diff-line add">710031=No! Don't go! Where are you going?! Please don't leave me!</div><div class="diff-line add">710032=Be not worried. I'm one of the Wildlings now, and I've found my calling!</div><div class="diff-line add">710033=I'll be back for you once I solve the conflict between the Wildlings and the Watchers.</div><div class="diff-line add">710034=But I...! Please take care of yourself... I'll be waiting for you in the Fortress!</div><div class="diff-line add">710035=We've spotted a place where survivors gathered. They are in danger and need our help.</div><div class="diff-line add">710036=Come join us, Chihiro. We can use someone capable, like you.</div><div class="diff-line add">710037=But...aren't you mad at me for what I said earlier?</div><div class="diff-line add">710038=Water under the bridge. What matters now is, do you still think I'm a traitor?</div><div class="diff-line add">710039=Of course not! I'm sorry...</div><div class="diff-line add">710040=Glad to hear that. Now let's save those survivors and build an even stronger team! Let's go!</div><div class="diff-line add">710041=Natalie, you're so kind. I wouldn't have guessed it, for I saw that "picture" of yours. There must be some kinda mistake.</div><div class="diff-line add">710042=You mean the one of me and the leader of the Vindicators? That's the evidence they used to frame me.</div><div class="diff-line add">710043=And it's why I came to the Fortress, to find proof to clear my name.</div><div class="diff-line add">710044=I believe you, Natalie! So do many other Minutemen. Don't worry. I'll help you find the proof you need!</div><div class="diff-line add">710045=Just received a new mission from Minutemen. I could use some help, guys!</div><div class="diff-line add">710046=If it's the mission from Minutemen, then count me in.</div><div class="diff-line add">710047=Here are the coordinates. Someone has been kidnapped, according to the intel.</div><div class="diff-line add">710048=We got our target. Let's move!</div><div class="diff-line add">710049=Crap, they got away!</div><div class="diff-line add">710050=A kerchief of one of the Vindicators... Guess they're the ones behind the abduction!</div><div class="diff-line add">710051=Who did they abduct, though, with all this effort? Some kind of bigwig?</div><div class="diff-line add">710052=Diana is the name that's been on the news lately. Apparently, she is a well-known geologist and a pretty one.</div><div class="diff-line add">710053=That's right. Her father was a prominent architect who left her with a "mysterious legacy" when he passed away.</div><div class="diff-line add">710054=So the Vindicators want to get the inheritance by abducting her, right?</div><div class="diff-line add">710055=Let's wait for more info from Minutemen. We also need to prepare ourselves in the meantime.</div><div class="diff-line add">710056=Welcome Back</div><div class="diff-line add">710057=Reunion</div><div class="diff-line add">710058=Foe or Ally</div><div class="diff-line add">710059=Reconcile</div><div class="diff-line add">710060=Rescue the Scholar</div><div class="diff-line add">710061=We received signals from Chihiro Fujiwara. She's one of the Minutemen! It looks like she needs our help!</div><div class="diff-line add">710062=We've received the coordinates from Chihiro's brother. Will Chihiro be reunited with her brother?</div><div class="diff-line add">710063=According to Chihiro, Natalie was a spy among the Minutemen... Let's not jump to conclusions just yet.</div><div class="diff-line add">710064=Reunited with her brother, Chihiro believed Natalie was not a spy. But will they be reconciled?</div><div class="diff-line add">710065=Minutemen issued an imminent rescue mission about a well-known geologist Diana being kidnapped!</div><div class="diff-line add">710066=According to Minutemen, a "well-known geologist" Diana was kidnapped.</div><div class="diff-line add">710067=Fernando, have you seen Natalie? I can't find her anywhere.</div><div class="diff-line add">710068=I think I saw her yesterday. She said she was going to the Subway to look for something.</div><div class="diff-line add">710069=Yesterday, you said? So she hasn't come back yet? I hope she's alright.</div><div class="diff-line add">710070=You don't suppose she is in danger or something, right? Should we go to the &lt;color=#ae6e55&gt;Subway&lt;/color&gt; and find her?</div><div class="diff-line add">710071=I'm opening the door. Stay sharp.</div><div class="diff-line add">710072=Hell, this place rubs me up the wrong way...</div><div class="diff-line add">710073=There's a ladder down there!</div><div class="diff-line add">710074=Okay, here's the plan, you go get some men, and we go down together.</div><div class="diff-line add">710075=So you're saying Natalie was looking for something at the Subway and hasn't returned yet? That doesn't sound like her.</div><div class="diff-line add">710076=It might have something to do with the note she found near the entrance. Dr. Gallo's signature was on it.</div><div class="diff-line add">710077=I thought about talking her out of it till at least we could all go together, but she seemed so excited.</div><div class="diff-line add">710078=Well, that's new. This Dr. Gallo, is he that famous scientist?</div><div class="diff-line add">710079=According to the news, he founded the Light Station to "bring humanity hope" a few years back. This must be the place!</div><div class="diff-line add">710080=I had no idea he was also Natalie's foster father!</div><div class="diff-line add">710081=Light Station to bring humanity hope...?</div><div class="diff-line add">710082=I don't care about some light station. Why are we still in this goddamn lift?!</div><div class="diff-line add">710083=Looks like we're in the Subway now. Everyone, stay alert.</div><div class="diff-line add">710084=This place looks creepy... Are you sure this is the Light Station?</div><div class="diff-line add">710085=It's been abandoned for years. Anything "light" had already been turned off.</div><div class="diff-line add">710086=What could be so important for Natalie to take this much risk... Crap, zombies!</div><div class="diff-line add">710087=That door might be for keeping something away. Was it to separate the Subway from the Fortress?</div><div class="diff-line add">710088=The zombies here haven't mutated, it seems. This place must have been in insulation for a long time.</div><div class="diff-line add">710089=A blood trail over there. It's recent. It might lead us to Natalie.</div><div class="diff-line add">710090=What the hell happened to this Station? Why is Dr. Gallo involved?</div><div class="diff-line add">710091=Let's move on. Natalie might have all the answers.</div><div class="diff-line add">710092=Check out those signs. That's not good.</div><div class="diff-line add">710093=Looks like some kinda warning.</div><div class="diff-line add">710094=It says, "Warning, the extremely dangerous Subject 04 has escaped Dr. Gallo's lab."</div><div class="diff-line add">710095=Subject 04? It all makes sense now. This must be where Dr. Strange did all his experiments.</div><div class="diff-line add">710096=So the door we encountered earlier was to keep Subject 04 away?</div><div class="diff-line add">710097=I don't believe Doc would perform experiments on zombies. They're "living" dead after all! He's an honorable man!</div><div class="diff-line add">710098=Something big is behind all this, a conspiracy! I can sense it with my genius perception!</div><div class="diff-line add">710099=Natalie, we found you at last!</div><div class="diff-line add">710100=Bout time! I could use some help with this big guy.</div><div class="diff-line add">710101=Is he Subject 04?</div><div class="diff-line add">710102=Watch out!</div><div class="diff-line add">710103=Thank god. Are you okay, Natalie?</div><div class="diff-line add">710104=I can't believe this! Natalie, what are you looking for in this damn forsaken place?!</div><div class="diff-line add">710105=A family photo...</div><div class="diff-line add">710106=A photo of you and Dr. Gallo?</div><div class="diff-line add">710107=A family photo of Dr. Gallo, his wife, a boy, and a little girl.</div><div class="diff-line add">710108=Fernando told us Dr. Gallo is your foster father. So you're the little girl!</div><div class="diff-line add">710109=That's right. Years ago, Dr. Gallo and his wife adopted me and another boy at this very Fortress.</div><div class="diff-line add">710110=You might also have guessed it. The boy was Enrique, the leader of Vindicators.</div><div class="diff-line add">710111=Doctor left Zeus with his wife and continued his research in this hidden Fortress.</div><div class="diff-line add">710112=Hoping, one day, to save humanity with a cure.</div><div class="diff-line add">710113=What happened then? Why is this place deserted? What happened to you?</div><div class="diff-line add">710114=Enrique happened. He staged a coup right after our father's success.</div><div class="diff-line add">710115=And that photo was our last family memory before he went rogue.</div><div class="diff-line add">710116=I don't understand. Why would he stage a coup when we all could get a cure?</div><div class="diff-line add">710117=So did you find the photo?</div><div class="diff-line add">710118=It should be in this room...</div><div class="diff-line add">710119=There, the photo...</div><div class="diff-line add">710120=Yes. This is the one... Wait...</div><div class="diff-line add">710121=So which one is you?</div><div class="diff-line add">710122=Idiot! She's not in it.</div><div class="diff-line add">710123=I was right there in this corner of the photo...that now had been torn off...</div><div class="diff-line add">710124=So you never contacted them after you were sent away? I mean Mr. And Mrs. Gallo.</div><div class="diff-line add">710125=No, I've never heard from them ever since. But I never expect...</div><div class="diff-line add">710126=If I remember right, there is another photo of us in the room downstairs! Can you guys...</div><div class="diff-line add">710127=We're here for you!</div><div class="diff-line add">710128=Not me! I don't wanna go there.</div><div class="diff-line add">710129=Fine then. Just don't come begging for food the following week!</div><div class="diff-line add">710130=On second thought...</div><div class="diff-line add">710131=Thank you, guys. The stairs to the lower level are just next door. Let's go.</div><div class="diff-line add">710132=So far, so good. Where do we start to look?</div><div class="diff-line add">710133=The longer we linger, the greater the danger. Let's split up and hurry.</div><div class="diff-line add">710134=No, no, no. I don't wanna be alone! I'll get scared!</div><div class="diff-line add">710135=Quiet, Fernando!</div><div class="diff-line add">710136=It's okay, Fernando. You go with Natalie. I'll go with Emma.</div><div class="diff-line add">710137=Put a sock in it, and man up, Fernando!</div><div class="diff-line add">710138=We'll go this way. Let us know if you find anything.</div><div class="diff-line add">710139=Okay. Be careful.</div><div class="diff-line add">710140=What...?</div><div class="diff-line add">710141=Two dead bodies. They've been here for a while.</div><div class="diff-line add">710142=How creepy... A zombie, female...</div><div class="diff-line add">710143=And a human...male.</div><div class="diff-line add">710144=There are no signs of fighting, and the scene is not messy.</div><div class="diff-line add">710145=A couple! But how?! A zombie and a human?!</div><div class="diff-line add">710146=Check this out.</div><div class="diff-line add">710147=A vial? What does it say?</div><div class="diff-line add">710148="Anti-Virus Sample C; Effective in Suppressing the Mutated Zombie Virus; Dr. Gallo"</div><div class="diff-line add">710149=Does it mean Doctor succeeded in making an anti-virus serum?</div><div class="diff-line add">710150=I believe, yes. I think you're right about these two bodies.</div><div class="diff-line add">710151=Are you saying the serum prevented the deterioration and kept her from attacking the man?</div><div class="diff-line add">710152=That's one way to explain it.</div><div class="diff-line add">710153=What a tragic end to die here while the Fortress was thrown into a chaotic rebellion...</div><div class="diff-line add">710154=Indeed... Wait! Did you hear that?</div><div class="diff-line add">710155=Anti-Virus Sample C</div><div class="diff-line add">710156=Developed by Dr. Gallo to suppress the mutated zombie virus. Unfortunately, though, the effect has been lost to time.</div><div class="diff-line add">710157=In the meantime...</div><div class="diff-line add">710158=Natalie! Natalie? I can't see anything. Where are you, Natalie?</div><div class="diff-line add">710159=I swear I was just with her two seconds ago.</div><div class="diff-line add">710160=What's this?</div><div class="diff-line add">710161=Is this... The blueprint of the Subway!</div><div class="diff-line add">710162=According to the blueprint, Brady and Emma should be in the room on the left. I'm at the staircase...</div><div class="diff-line add">710163=Natalie should be in the room on the right if I'm not mistaken.</div><div class="diff-line add">710164=That's...the lab! Crap! I got a bad feeling about this!</div><div class="diff-line add">710165=Fernando, it's just you? Where is Natalie?</div><div class="diff-line add">710166=Finally, you two are here. Look what I found, a blueprint!</div><div class="diff-line add">710167=Natalie left me when I was checking the blueprint. She should be in the room on the right!</div><div class="diff-line add">710168=Are you sure? Let's get to her, then.</div><div class="diff-line add">710169=Subway Blueprint</div><div class="diff-line add">710170=A blueprint of the subway shows many reinforced structures to prevent test subjects from escaping.</div><div class="diff-line add">710171=Family Photo</div><div class="diff-line add">710172=A photo of Mr. and Mrs. Gallo and their adopted son and daughter depicts a loving family in the good old days...</div><div class="diff-line add">710173=Warning Poster</div><div class="diff-line add">710174=Warning, Subject 04 has escaped the lab!</div><div class="diff-line add">710175=This photo looks so...familiar...</div><div class="diff-line add">710176=The photo Natalie showed us. This is the other part that got torn off! Let's put it together!</div><div class="diff-line add">710177=Don't worry, Natalie. We'll always be there for you!</div><div class="diff-line add">710178=The car is fixed. Shall we go?</div><div class="diff-line add">710179=Let's go, Natalie. We'll find Dr. Gallo together!</div><div class="diff-line add">710180=Okay, Let's do this!</div><div class="diff-line add">710181=They died in each other's arms. No struggle... It's just like...</div><div class="diff-line add">710182=Well, guess the result didn't turn out as he expected...</div><div class="diff-line add">710183=Let's not jump to conclusions just yet. Natalie might tell us the truth after we find her.</div><div class="diff-line add">710184=He wanted to rule the Fortress with it, to have power and all!</div><div class="diff-line add">710185=Father would never let that happen. That's why Enrique resorted to a different plan...</div><div class="diff-line add">710186=So even Dr. Gallo couldn't bring out the bright side of Enrique. His wickedness only grows with age!</div><div class="diff-line add">710187=She's always the cautious one. She knows how dangerous that place is!</div><div class="diff-line add">710188=Saying Dr. Gallo was her foster father and she could handle herself in the subway. And then she just left...</div><div class="diff-line add">710189=You have not cleared the Subway stages and are not able to start the exploration.</div><div class="diff-line add">710190=I'm glad that I was adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Gallo.</div><div class="diff-line add">710191=Well, Enrique did not seem to be very happy about that.</div><div class="diff-line add">710192=If Dr. Gallo's experiment works out, perhaps we could really save the world.</div><div class="diff-line add">710193=But Enrique wanted to monopolize the vaccines for power and money. That's how our argument started.</div><div class="diff-line add">710194=I saw Enrique switched some vaccines. A catastrophe was looming on the horizon.</div><div class="diff-line add">710195=The wrong vaccines led to a zombie crisis in the Fortress. Another period of chaos hence began.</div><div class="diff-line add">710196=Worse still, my foster mother contracted the zombie virus. Dr. Gallo had to send me away. Enrique disappeared as well.</div><div class="diff-line add">710197=Unlocks at Fortress Lv. 7</div><div class="diff-line add">710200=According to the radar, Rebecca is trapped in this building.</div><div class="diff-line add">710201=Let's go rescue her immediately!</div><div class="diff-line add">710202=Watch out! Zombies ahead!</div><div class="diff-line add">710203=Check this out. Fresh footprints. Someone was here.</div><div class="diff-line add">710204=Let's look around.</div><div class="diff-line add">710205=Recent handprint on this chest. Someone opened it not long ago.</div><div class="diff-line add">710206=It must've been Rebecca. She beat us here.</div><div class="diff-line add">710207=The ladder leading down is cleared. Let's go down and have a look.</div><div class="diff-line add">710208=The collapsed &lt;color=#ae6e55&gt;blocks&lt;/color&gt; are in our way.</div><div class="diff-line add">710209=Don't sweat it just yet. There's an abandoned tool shed.</div><div class="diff-line add">710210=Once it's &lt;color=#ae6e55&gt;repaired&lt;/color&gt;, we should find the tool for excavation.</div><div class="diff-line add">710211=Well, all yours.</div><div class="diff-line add">710212=Perfect. Let's go &lt;color=#ae6e55&gt;excavate&lt;/color&gt; a way out.</div><div class="diff-line add">710213=Careful, I heard zombies growling up ahead.</div><div class="diff-line add">710214=It's mutated. Looks like it's protecting something. Keep your guard up!</div><div class="diff-line add">710215=The marker on the chest is the symbol the Minutemen use to mark their way! Rebecca must be right ahead.</div><div class="diff-line add">710216=Don't sweat it just yet. Look! Here's a Work Station.</div><div class="diff-line add">710217=Rebecca! At last! Are you hurt?</div><div class="diff-line add">710218=Natalie! Thank god you got my distress signal.</div><div class="diff-line add">710219=I was investigating the survivors' gathering place when I encountered mutated zombies.</div><div class="diff-line add">710220=Their attacks caused the blocks to collapse. If it weren't for you, I...!!!</div><div class="diff-line add">710221=Sorry to interrupt. How about we save the rest after we get back to the Fortress?</div><div class="diff-line add">710222=Our surroundings are about to collapse at any moment.</div><div class="diff-line add">710223=You're right. Everyone at the Fortress will be happy to see you again.</div><div class="diff-line add">710224=After a while...</div><div class="diff-line add">710225=The whole room is cluttered with junk.</div><div class="diff-line add">710226=Let's clean it up and see if we can find anything.</div><div class="diff-line add">710227=Brady, I found a chest here.</div><div class="diff-line add">710228=Help! I'm here!</div><div class="diff-line add">710230=Crap. The road is blocked.</div><div class="diff-line add">710231=Let's see if we can find some handy tools.</div><div class="diff-line add">710232=Look what I found! A pickaxe!</div><div class="diff-line add">710233=Now let's go rescue Rebecca!</div><div class="diff-line add">710234=Pickaxe</div><div class="diff-line add">710235=A durable pickaxe that can be used to break any hard clods</div><div class="diff-line add">710236=Let's continue our exploration.</div><div class="diff-line add">710237=What's that...?</div><div class="diff-line add">710238=It's Rebecca's bag. The strap probably was ripped apart in a battle.</div><div class="diff-line add">710239=Let's head down as fast as possible!</div><div class="diff-line add">710240=Lost Bag</div><div class="diff-line add">710241=The strap was ripped apart. It probably was dropped by her in a haste.</div><div class="diff-line add">710300=According to the radar, Chihiro Fujiwara is trapped in this building.</div><div class="diff-line add">710301=It must've been Chihiro. She beat us here.</div><div class="diff-line add">710302=The marker is the symbol the Minutemen use to mark their way! Chihiro must be right ahead.</div><div class="diff-line add">710303=Chihiro! At last! Are you hurt?</div><div class="diff-line add">710304=Welcome back, Chihiro! How have you been?</div><div class="diff-line add">710305=Sorry. No time for small talk.</div><div class="diff-line add">710306=Remember that building I was trapped in when I was investigating the survivors' gathering place?</div><div class="diff-line add">710307=Using the Fortress radar, I picked up my brother's distress signal from there. I must go find him.</div><div class="diff-line add">710308=Let's not waste any time, then. We can catch up later after we rescue Chihiro's brother!</div><div class="diff-line add">710309=You're safe, Diana. Now that we got you out, the Fortress will protect you.</div><div class="diff-line add">710310=Thank god! I couldn't take it anymore... Those Vindicators... They're a bunch of lunatics!</div><div class="diff-line add">710311=Anyway, you have my eternal gratitude! I'll do whatever I can to repay your kindness!</div><div class="diff-line add">710312=It's okay, Diana. People at the Fortress are all nice and friendly. No more Vindicators.</div><div class="diff-line add">710313=Now let's go rescue Chihiro!</div><div class="diff-line add">710314=It's Chihiro's bag. The strap probably was ripped apart in a battle.</div><div class="diff-line add">710400=Help! Help!</div><div class="diff-line add">710401=Please keep calm and tell me what happened.</div><div class="diff-line add">710402=I'm Helen, a researcher at Zeus Group. This is the Laboratory of Ruins! We were attacked by zombies!</div><div class="diff-line add">710403=Are you the only one here? Any other survivors?</div><div class="diff-line add">710404=And Dr. Wolowitz! He's injured. Just over there. Please help us!</div><div class="diff-line add">710405=Alright. Please take me there.</div><div class="diff-line add">710406=Wolowitz, how are you? Are you okay?</div><div class="diff-line add">710407=I'm fine. I was there when the zombies attacked, but luckily I only hurt my leg.</div><div class="diff-line add">710408=If I were bitten...the consequences could be tragic. Who is this?</div><div class="diff-line add">710409=Let me introduce, this is Dr. Wolowitz, a key member of the Laboratory, and this is...</div><div class="diff-line add">710410=And, what's your name, please?</div><div class="diff-line add">710411=I'm Palmer. I'm here to investigate the accident. Can you give me a detailed account of what happened?</div><div class="diff-line add">710412=Zeus Group discovered alien ruins that did not belong to Earth during resource extraction, and then discovered genetic modification technology after further research. As a result, the group organized a research team of experts from all over the world and gradually developed as many as a hundred laboratories.</div><div class="diff-line add">710413=In conjunction with the militaries of various countries, Zeus Group genetically engineered soldiers, allowing the experiment to progress quickly. However, the situation deteriorated rapidly as cases of engineered human variation arose in experimental bases in various regions. Within six months, the zombie virus had spread rapidly around the world...</div><div class="diff-line add">710414=This is how it happened...</div><div class="diff-line add">710415=So instead of being attacked by zombies, we actually created them...</div><div class="diff-line add">710416=...</div><div class="diff-line add">710417=Is there a safe zone around here that you're familiar with? I'll get you there.</div><div class="diff-line add">710418=Dr. Gallo appears to have gone to the Ark Safe Zone, which is the closest safe zone.</div><div class="diff-line add">710419=It's better for us to meet up with Dr. Gallo as soon as possible.</div><div class="diff-line add">710420=But there are zombies all around. What should we do?</div><div class="diff-line add">710421=Don't worry. I'll handle them. Stay close to me.</div><div class="diff-line add">710422=We're safe now. Wolowitz, do you feel better?</div><div class="diff-line add">710423=Thank you so much, Palmer. Please help us with a very important thing!</div><div class="diff-line add">710424=Wait! Are you sure you want to tell her about this?</div><div class="diff-line add">710425=I believe Ms. Palmer can be trusted. She saved us and she is very capable, isn't she?</div><div class="diff-line add">710426=Alright. Ms. Palmer, our Laboratory has developed a preliminary viral vaccine.</div><div class="diff-line add">710427=It's right in the drop location ahead, and it's really important to us!</div><div class="diff-line add">710428=Wait! You mean, like, a vaccine for the zombie virus?</div><div class="diff-line add">710429=Yes, it could neutralize the zombie virus before the infected went mutant.</div><div class="diff-line add">710430=But we only succeeded to a limited extent. This batch of vaccines needs to be sent to a safe place ASAP!</div><div class="diff-line add">710431=But why would Zeus Group develop a vaccine while it's striving to develop genetic modification?</div><div class="diff-line add">710432=It's a long story. Let's go check the vaccine first!</div><div class="diff-line add">710433=Looks like it's an empty box.</div><div class="diff-line add">710434=Are you sure it's here? It seems to be no vaccine here...</div><div class="diff-line add">710435=This should be the right place. Why isn't Dr. Gallo here? He won't be in danger, right?</div><div class="diff-line add">710436=There are no signs of any fighting here, and this location was known only to a few of us.</div><div class="diff-line add">710437=Maybe we arrived here late and Dr. Gallo went to the next institute with the vaccine.</div><div class="diff-line add">710438=If so, I'm relieved. And how's your leg?</div><div class="diff-line add">710439=...if my injury hadn't slowed us down, we would have met up with Gallo.</div><div class="diff-line add">710440=Don't care that much. I'll get you to a nearby safe zone for treatment.</div><div class="diff-line add">710441=If you trust me, I'll help you find Dr. Gallo.</div><div class="diff-line add">710442=Really? Thank you so much. I'll give you the follow-up data when we get to the safe zone.</div><div class="diff-line add">710443=Here we are. This is the largest safe zone around the Ruins Laboratory.</div><div class="diff-line add">710444=Thank you for helping us all the way, Ms. Palmer.</div><div class="diff-line add">710445=My question might not be polite, but...Why do you want to help us? And why are you investigating this matter?</div><div class="diff-line add">710446=Because I am a Lawbringer. We are Lawbringers. It is our duty to make the world develop in order...</div><div class="diff-line add">710447=Help me!</div><div class="diff-line add">710448=Oh, no! Wolowitz's injury was aggravated!</div><div class="diff-line add">710449=I remember there were medical supplies nearby...</div><div class="diff-line add">710450=10 years ago, the initial stage of the virus hitting</div><div class="diff-line add">710451=You mean...your guys?</div><div class="diff-line add">710452=Anyway, thank you very much for your help. This is the address of the next Laboratory. Please find Dr. Gallo.</div><div class="diff-line add">710453=That's true! Ms. Palmer, the vaccine Dr. Gallo possessed is vital to this dire situation.</div><div class="diff-line add">710454=OK. I'll keep that address in mind. You may rest assured. Take good care of yourselves.</div><div class="diff-line add">710455=Looks like it's an empty laboratory.</div><div class="diff-line add">710456=It seems like people here have been relocated.</div><div class="diff-line add">710457=What is Zeus Group covering up?</div><div class="diff-line add">710458=Please help me!</div><div class="diff-line add">710459=You got hurt. Are you alright? Why are you here alone?</div><div class="diff-line add">710460=I'm Grace. I work at Gallo Laboratory.</div><div class="diff-line add">710461=I accidentally cut my arm when I was being chased by zombies. Don't worry about me.</div><div class="diff-line add">710462=You mean, you're Dr. Gallo's assistant?</div><div class="diff-line add">710463=Yes. Unfortunately, a huge wave of zombies popped up around here, then Dr. Gallo and I got separated.</div><div class="diff-line add">710464=Do you know where Dr. Gallo went? Or do you have an agreed destination?</div><div class="diff-line add">710465=If that's what you're asking...</div><div class="diff-line add">710466=By the way, I guess I didn't get a chance to thank you for your help, and I don't know your name.</div><div class="diff-line add">710467=I'm Palmer, coming from the ruins, and I met a lot of employees of Zeus Group along the way.</div><div class="diff-line add">710468=Don't worry. I'm here to investigate the cause of those zombies, and you can trust me.</div><div class="diff-line add">710469=I see. But where are you going to investigate it now?</div><div class="diff-line add">710470=I heard Dr. Gallo was carrying the key vaccine for the zombie virus, and I was on my way to find him.</div><div class="diff-line add">710471=Yes, he is at the institute ahead. But my arm...</div><div class="diff-line add">710472=Don't worry. I see an airdrop of medical kits ahead. Follow me, please.</div><div class="diff-line add">710473=Where are you going?</div><div class="diff-line add">710474=(Why did she leave without saying a word?)</div><div class="diff-line add">710475=(Looks like I'm treated as a badass. What has happened to human beings?)</div><div class="diff-line add">710476=(As things stand, the zombie vaccine seems to be a secret project, and I need to gain Helen's trust.)</div><div class="diff-line add">710477=Sorry. I was anxious to check on Dr. Gallo.</div><div class="diff-line add">710478=That's fine, but it looks like we're still too late.</div><div class="diff-line add">710479=Now can you tell me about Dr. Gallo?</div><div class="diff-line add">710480=Dr. Gallo was the first to discover the genetic modification in the ruins.</div><div class="diff-line add">710481=But soon after he started researching the technology, he saw its pitfalls.</div><div class="diff-line add">710482=But Zeus Group didn't care, saying the tech is just "not ready" now, then began plenty of experiments at once.</div><div class="diff-line add">710483=So Dr. Gallo began working on a technique to reverse the genetic modification, which is the vaccine.</div><div class="diff-line add">710484=But his worst fears were realized.</div><div class="diff-line add">710485=So Dr. Gallo's technique is still a secret, right?</div><div class="diff-line add">710486=Well, it was a secret, but looks like it's not anymore.</div><div class="diff-line add">710487=Why would you say so?</div><div class="diff-line add">710488=Apparently, the institute has been exposed.</div><div class="diff-line add">710489=All the survivors who knew about the vaccine were planning to loot the "secret".</div><div class="diff-line add">710490=Like what you said, we're too late. The vaccines here have been looted.</div><div class="diff-line add">710491=Why hide these vaccines? The survivors are really in need of these vaccines right now.</div><div class="diff-line add">710492=No, Dr. Gallo's plan is to distribute the vaccines to different factions of survivors.</div><div class="diff-line add">710493=I see. I can help you if you would like to trust me.</div><div class="diff-line add">710494=There's a secret location nearby where the vaccine is kept.</div><div class="diff-line add">710495=But it's been exposed, and if you can help me keep these vaccines, I'll trust you.</div><div class="diff-line add">710496=Let's go.</div><div class="diff-line add">710497=Oh, no! They are coming for the vaccine!</div><div class="diff-line add">710498=Don't worry. I'll never let them take it.</div><div class="diff-line add">710499=Phew...Luckily we got there in time, no, I mean, luckily you are here.</div><div class="diff-line add">710500=You hurt?</div><div class="diff-line add">710501=It's okay. I'm not hurt. Oh, good. The vaccines are safe, too.</div><div class="diff-line add">710502=Now you can trust me?</div><div class="diff-line add">710503=Sure. Up until just now, I was desperate, but now I can trust you with the vaccine.</div><div class="diff-line add">710504=That's all right with me. So what's next? What's your plan?</div><div class="diff-line add">710505=Let's split up from here. I went to Dr. Gallo as planned.</div><div class="diff-line add">710506=I'll leave the planned vaccine delivery to you, Ms. Palmer!</div><div class="diff-line add">710507=OK.</div><div class="diff-line add">710508=The Stations of those factions are too far from here.</div><div class="diff-line add">710509=I have to figure out a way. How do I get there...</div><div class="diff-line add">710510=...</div><div class="diff-line add">710511=There's a call button! Fix it, then I should be able to call in the vehicle of Zeus Group.</div><div class="diff-line add">710512=It's finally fixed. Let me see where the first stop is...</div><div class="diff-line add">710513=The clan of Wildlings.</div><div class="diff-line add">710514=Wait. You are...?</div><div class="diff-line add">710515=Get out of my way! I saw this vehicle with vaccines first! (impatient)</div><div class="diff-line add">710516=...Hi, I'm Palmer. It was meant to be the vaccine delivered to Wildlings.</div><div class="diff-line add">710517=What? Tut. You must have been sent by Gallo...the flunkies of Zeus Group! Bah!</div><div class="diff-line add">710518=Oh, you got me wrong. I'm not...</div><div class="diff-line add">710519=You listen to me. I don't care who you are. It was I who found the vaccines.</div><div class="diff-line add">710520=You want to complete your delivery mission? Just send another box of vaccines. Haha...</div><div class="diff-line add">710521=Are you...robbing me?</div><div class="diff-line add">710522=Shut up! Robbing Zeus Group is not robbing! Hand it over!</div><div class="diff-line add">710523=(Looks like Zeus Group has a bad reputation at Wildlings...)</div><div class="diff-line add">710524=(What's next? Let me see...it's Minutemen.)</div><div class="diff-line add">710525=Hi, comrade! I'm Alisa from Minutemen.</div><div class="diff-line add">710526=Please stop. I need details about you and the vaccine.</div><div class="diff-line add">710527=I'm Palmer from Lawbringers. I'm here to investigate the cause of the zombies.</div><div class="diff-line add">710528=I've been requested by Dr. Gallo's Laboratory to deliver vaccines to four Factions.</div><div class="diff-line add">710529=I see. Thanks for your hard work, Ms. Palmer. And thank you for the vaccine!</div><div class="diff-line add">710530=Oh, by the way, is Dr. Gallo fine?</div><div class="diff-line add">710531=Unfortunately, I haven't met up with Dr. Gallo. He got separated from Grace among the zombies.</div><div class="diff-line add">710532=But Grace is on her way to Dr. Gallo, so I'm sure we'll hear from them soon.</div><div class="diff-line add">710533=Dr. Gallo is sure to come through it. We'll take the vaccines and distribute them to the survivors in the camp.</div><div class="diff-line add">710534=Speaking of zombies, Minutemen recently found some intel. I don't know if it works for Ms. Palmer.</div><div class="diff-line add">710535=We don't know if the intel is useful until we hear it. Please.</div><div class="diff-line add">710536=These days, Minutemen frequently received help messages, and there is a common feature in these cases.</div><div class="diff-line add">710537=They were all attacked by a monster that is half-human and half-zombie.</div><div class="diff-line add">710538=It first appeared near a laboratory of Zeus Group.</div><div class="diff-line add">710539=Half-human and half-zombie? (pondering)</div><div class="diff-line add">710540=Thank you. This is a very useful clue!</div><div class="diff-line add">710541=I'm glad it's useful. Ms. Palmer, thank you for your help!</div><div class="diff-line add">710542=I'm starting to investigate the monster. Until next time, see you, Alisa.</div><div class="diff-line add">710543=...(handing over the vaccines)</div><div class="diff-line add">710544=...(skeptical face)</div><div class="diff-line add">710545=Just say it.</div><div class="diff-line add">710546=Hello, this is Palmer from Lawbringers. And this is the vaccine for you.</div><div class="diff-line add">710547=Lawbringers? Just name your price.</div><div class="diff-line add">710548=Is there some kind of misunderstanding? I'm here to deliver the vaccine for Dr. Gallo...</div><div class="diff-line add">710549=Gallo? Ah, he should be responsible for this zombie virus. Now he's crying crocodile tears?</div><div class="diff-line add">710550=You're working with him? So you're not a good one. Leave the vaccines and get out of here!</div><div class="diff-line add">710551=...I'm Palmer from Lawbringers. I don't know Mr. Gallo. And Lawbringers is...</div><div class="diff-line add">710552=Is what? I know who you are. You call yourself the protector of order. Nothing but impractical. Idiot.</div><div class="diff-line add">710553=I guess I don't have to explain myself. Have you seen any monster which is half-human and half-zombie recently?</div><div class="diff-line add">710554=Monster? The biggest monster I've seen recently is you, isn't it?</div><div class="diff-line add">710555=Preserve order...Really funny. Where were you when the zombies broke out?</div><div class="diff-line add">710556=Now pretend to be good. Why would you need a parachute if the plane already crashed? Get as far away as you can!</div><div class="diff-line add">710557=...then goodbye.</div><div class="diff-line add">710558=Hello, I'm David, one of the Watchers.</div><div class="diff-line add">710559=Hi, I'm Palmer. In the car is the vaccine Gallo requested me to deliver here.</div><div class="diff-line add">710560=Much appreciated. With all due respect, are you Palmer from Lawbringers?</div><div class="diff-line add">710561=Yes, Mr. David. You know about us?</div><div class="diff-line add">710562=Certainly. But what are your ideas for dealing with the current crisis, Ms. Palmer?</div><div class="diff-line add">710563=Dr. Gallo has developed a vaccine. We can widely distribute the vaccine from the perspective of prevention.</div><div class="diff-line add">710564=But Mr. David, if you asked so, do you think there's a better way?</div><div class="diff-line add">710565=There is no unified belief in the world today, and people are not of one mind.</div><div class="diff-line add">710566=People are suspicious of each other. There are many serious obstacles to popularizing the vaccine.</div><div class="diff-line add">710567=You must have experienced this, Ms. Palmer.</div><div class="diff-line add">710568=Yes, I've been to three camps before, and people have different attitudes toward the vaccine.</div><div class="diff-line add">710569=It's important to bring together as many survivors as possible to exploit the advantages of human strengths.</div><div class="diff-line add">710570=You're right, Mr. David. Then there should be a safe, large place to shelter the survivors.</div><div class="diff-line add">710571=As far as I know, there is a highly secured system at Eden, which attracted many survivors.</div><div class="diff-line add">710572=But in Apocalypse, it's hard for survivors to find the way. If we can light Eden's beam, we can do more with less.</div><div class="diff-line add">710573=I see. Thank you, Mr. David. By the way, have you heard anything strange around here recently?</div><div class="diff-line add">710574=Are you talking about the monster which is half-zombie and half-human?</div><div class="diff-line add">710575=Yes. Have you seen it, Mr. David?</div><div class="diff-line add">710576=I heard that a monster recently appeared near the Everest community, the largest human community. You can go there.</div><div class="diff-line add">710577=Here's what happens.</div><div class="diff-line add">710578=Everest community?...</div><div class="diff-line add">710579=I can go there next.</div><div class="diff-line add">710580=Can anyone help me? I would give you anything you want!</div><div class="diff-line add">710581=Please stay calm. Is there anything I can do for you? Take it easy.</div><div class="diff-line add">710582=I got separated from my family!</div><div class="diff-line add">710583=My brother and I made an appointment to go to the Everest community, but...</div><div class="diff-line add">710584=On the way there we met a hideous, scary monster!</div><div class="diff-line add">710585=Half-human and half-zombie. Is that what you're talking about?</div><div class="diff-line add">710586=Yes, it is! They say it's brutal, bloodthirsty, and murderous!</div><div class="diff-line add">710587=My brother and I got separated trying to avoid it. I am very concerned for his safety.</div><div class="diff-line add">710588=But we common survivors have no means of communication, so we can't communicate with each other in time.</div><div class="diff-line add">710589=If you could help me find my brother, I'll give you all supplies I have left!</div><div class="diff-line add">710590=I don't need your supplies. I will help you. Just tell me where the monster appeared.</div><div class="diff-line add">710591=I will light Eden's lights as a signal.</div><div class="diff-line add">710592=After that, you take the survivors of the Everest community to Eden, where you will be reunited with your brother.</div><div class="diff-line add">710593=OK. Thank you very much!</div><div class="diff-line add">710594=(According to the resident's directions, the monster is right ahead.)</div><div class="diff-line add">710595=(I need to deal with this threat as soon as possible, then light the lights of Eden...)</div><div class="diff-line add">710596=...it's you!</div><div class="diff-line add">710597=I've been looking for you for a long time.</div><div class="diff-line add">710598=What a coincidence. So do I!</div><div class="diff-line add">710599=Let the survivor go!</div><div class="diff-line add">710600=Ugh...(groaning)</div><div class="diff-line add">710601=Why don't you just kill me?</div><div class="diff-line add">710602=You...are you a human being or a zombie?</div><div class="diff-line add">710603=What? You can't kill me because I'm a human being?</div><div class="diff-line add">710604=I should have killed you!</div><div class="diff-line add">710605=If you kill me, I will kill this wretch.</div><div class="diff-line add">710606=No!</div><div class="diff-line add">710607=Calm down. You can leave, but you have to let the survivor go!</div><div class="diff-line add">710608=Hahaha...deal!</div><div class="diff-line add">710609=Thank you. You saved me.</div><div class="diff-line add">710610=Your brother asked me to come. He was worried about you.</div><div class="diff-line add">710611=Come on. Let's light up Eden. So the survivors would gather.</div><div class="diff-line add">710612=Thank you. We are saved!</div><div class="diff-line add">710613=Hurry up! It's our big day!</div><div class="diff-line add">710614=Where is Cloud? We agreed to take this vaccine together!</div><div class="diff-line add">710615=Shh! The vaccine heist is our secret plan. Don't let anyone hear about it.</div><div class="diff-line add">710616=I know. Gallo is the only one protecting this batch of vaccine for Zeus Group. It is a piece of cake.</div><div class="diff-line add">710617=Let's go find Cloud. He went ahead to sniff around.</div><div class="diff-line add">710618=Okay.</div><div class="diff-line add">710619=Whew... If you're any late, I'll be eaten by zombies!</div><div class="diff-line add">710620=Hey! Where were you just now? Do you want to monopolize the vaccine?</div><div class="diff-line add">710621=Listen! According to the latest news, there's been a fire at the branch of Zeus Group.</div><div class="diff-line add">710622=That place is a mess. It's our chance to loot. Haha!</div><div class="diff-line add">710623=Ugh...</div><div class="diff-line add">710624=Oh, my god! Shit! Soros has been bitten!</div><div class="diff-line add">710625=Damn it! This is not a good time to get injured!</div><div class="diff-line add">710626=What should we do now? If we don't get there, it'll be too late...</div><div class="diff-line add">710627=Help me...Ugh...</div><div class="diff-line add">710628=Just ignore him and get over there. He's gonna die anyway.</div><div class="diff-line add">710629=What...Damn it!</div><div class="diff-line add">710630=Ugh! Help me! Patrick! Please...</div><div class="diff-line add">710631=How are you feeling? Soros! Hey! Answer me...</div><div class="diff-line add">710632=I...I feel something happening in my body...</div><div class="diff-line add">710633=Hang in there. We're on our way to a vaccine stronghold ahead.</div><div class="diff-line add">710634=Mmm...</div><div class="diff-line add">710635=Something has to be done about this sticky situation...</div><div class="diff-line add">710636=Oh, no! Zombies are coming again!</div><div class="diff-line add">710637=Quick! Shoot it up!</div><div class="diff-line add">710638=I had one shot. But I don't think it worked...</div><div class="diff-line add">710639=What? Damn it! The zombies are closing in.</div><div class="diff-line add">710640=Soros, we did the best we could...Good luck.</div><div class="diff-line add">710641=What do you mean?</div><div class="diff-line add">710642=We are in the Doomsday! We can only be responsible for ourselves!</div><div class="diff-line add">710643=Patrick took all the rest of the vaccine.</div><div class="diff-line add">710644=Damn it! They deserted me!</div><div class="diff-line add">710645=&lt;size=30&gt;I must revenge myself to those who betrayed me!&lt;/size&gt;</div><div class="diff-line add">710646=Where is Cloud?</div><div class="diff-line add">710647=Help! Help!</div><div class="diff-line add">710648=I remember there is a stronghold of Zeus Group ahead.</div><div class="diff-line add">710649=I hope Cloud didn't take all the vaccine...</div><div class="diff-line add">710650=Soros? No! No way! Why are you still awake?</div><div class="diff-line add">710651=You were bitten by the zombie...Oh, my god! Monster! Get the hell away from me!</div><div class="diff-line add">710652=You betrayed me. I'll never forgive you! I'm going to kill you...</div><div class="diff-line add">710653=Stop it! You want the vaccine? Go through me.</div><div class="diff-line add">710654=Help! Help me! This monster is trying to kill me.</div><div class="diff-line add">710655=I thought you guys were after the vaccine. Turns out you're infected.</div><div class="diff-line add">710656=The one who's not infected, get out of here! He can't be saved.</div><div class="diff-line add">710657=OK. I'm leaving right now...</div><div class="diff-line add">710658=How are you feeling? Let me take a look at your wound.</div><div class="diff-line add">710659=He betrayed me! Why did you let him go?</div><div class="diff-line add">710660=You can think logically. Looks like you can still be saved.</div><div class="diff-line add">710661=...</div><div class="diff-line add">710662=Let me see your wound.</div><div class="diff-line add">710663=Why did you save me?</div><div class="diff-line add">710664=That's all I can do. The rest is up to you.</div><div class="diff-line add">710665=If you feel like you can survive as a human being, go get your friends to help you.</div><div class="diff-line add">710666=But if you feel like you're going to turn into a zombie, stay away from the survivors.</div><div class="diff-line add">710667=I...</div><div class="diff-line add">710668=How are you still alive?</div><div class="diff-line add">710669=Sorry to disappoint you. I'm not dead yet! I'll take you with me if I die!</div><div class="diff-line add">710670=What are you doing? Stop it, you hideous monster!</div><div class="diff-line add">710671=What happened?</div><div class="diff-line add">710672=What are you doing to my friend, you monster!</div><div class="diff-line add">710673=Watch out, Betty! He has lost his mind!</div><div class="diff-line add">710674=Oh, my friends? They are just people who left me behind when we are in danger.</div><div class="diff-line add">710675=You're gonna die right here!</div><div class="diff-line add">710676=I'll let you taste how it feels when no one will come to help!</div><div class="diff-line add">710677=You're gonna lose all your friends! Soros, you'll regret it!</div><div class="diff-line add">710678=Oh, speaking of friends...It's time to settle some old scores with Cloud.</div><div class="diff-line add">710679=No. He will lose his human nature if he continues.</div><div class="diff-line add">710680=I need to find a way to stop him...</div><div class="diff-line add">710681=This is the first time a human being bitten by zombies didn't completely mutate.</div><div class="diff-line add">710682=I'll ask the boss for help.</div><div class="diff-line add">710683=Oh my God! What an ugly creature! It's so ugly! Ugly as hell!</div><div class="diff-line add">710684=Hey! Are you talking about me, old woman? Don't you dare say that again?</div><div class="diff-line add">710685=Human has finally angered the Nature! This is what will eventually happen to all human beings!</div><div class="diff-line add">710686=Genetic modification is the forbidden Pandora's Box! And you are the devil that the box unleashed!</div><div class="diff-line add">710687=Crazy woman, call Cloud out, or you all die together!</div><div class="diff-line add">710688=Oh, my god! Soros, how did you ever get like this?</div><div class="diff-line add">710689=The catastrophe! Mankind will eventually face the catastrophe of its own making!</div><div class="diff-line add">710690=Cloud, are you surprised to see me like this?</div><div class="diff-line add">710691=It's all your fault! Take the consequences!</div><div class="diff-line add">710692=Oh, no, zombies! We need to retreat!</div><div class="diff-line add">710693=Run, Jessie! Stay away from him!</div><div class="diff-line add">710694=&lt;size=30&gt;Go to hell!!&lt;/size&gt;</div><div class="diff-line add">710695=No...my body...</div><div class="diff-line add">710696=Hurry up! Leave now!</div><div class="diff-line add">710697=There is a constant flow of energy coming out...Ugh! I'm about to lose control!</div><div class="diff-line add">710698=Those zombies...they don't attack me anymore.</div><div class="diff-line add">710699=I can't go on like this. I have to ask for help!</div><div class="diff-line add">710700=Oh, Minutemen! They will find a way to help me!</div><div class="diff-line add">710701=Please help me...Don't be afraid. I'm human.</div><div class="diff-line add">710702=May I ask what happened to you?</div><div class="diff-line add">710703=I was bitten by a zombie. I've had two shots of the vaccine.</div><div class="diff-line add">710704=The virus is barely under control, but I feel like I'm losing control of my body...</div><div class="diff-line add">710705=Please help me! I just want a dose of the vaccine!</div><div class="diff-line add">710706=You may rest assured that we will do our best to help you. Please follow me...</div><div class="diff-line add">710707=You...This is a part of your conspiracy!</div><div class="diff-line add">710708=I didn't realize that even the Minutemen were just a bunch of phony guys!</div><div class="diff-line add">710709=Hahahaha. Well, I'm not human in your eyes anymore!</div><div class="diff-line add">710710=No, Soros. Listen to me...We are here to help you.</div><div class="diff-line add">710711=But for the safety of the rest of the Minutemen, we need to take you somewhere else.</div><div class="diff-line add">710712=You should've known that when you left after I was bitten by a zombie.</div><div class="diff-line add">710713=I'll never believe anything you say. Go to hell!</div><div class="diff-line add">710714=This is all because of that vaccine!</div><div class="diff-line add">710715=If I hadn't gone for the vaccine, I wouldn't have been bitten by that damn zombie!</div><div class="diff-line add">710716=If I hadn't gotten the shot, I wouldn't be in this half-human, half-zombie mess...</div><div class="diff-line add">710717=And that Palmer! Yes...It's her fault!</div><div class="diff-line add">710718=I have to find her!</div><div class="diff-line add">710719=Hey, loser! Have you ever seen a woman who dresses in a high-flown style?</div><div class="diff-line add">710720=Ah! Monster!</div><div class="diff-line add">710721=Crap, he got away!</div><div class="diff-line add">710722=You! What are you doing? Don't hurt me! Don't kill me!</div><div class="diff-line add">710723=Have you ever heard of Palmer?</div><div class="diff-line add">710724=Palmer...Palmer...She...</div><div class="diff-line add">710725=A woman with hair glows gold. You remember?</div><div class="diff-line add">710726=She...She went to Watchers base! I don't know anything else! Please don't kill me!</div><div class="diff-line add">710727=Get Palmer out, or I'll tear this place down!</div><div class="diff-line add">710728=I've been waiting for you.</div><div class="diff-line add">710729=What?</div><div class="diff-line add">710730=Damn it! I was caught in your ambush!</div><div class="diff-line add">710731=Miss Palmer is on an important mission here.</div><div class="diff-line add">710732=We waited here early to ensure that she would not be disturbed.</div><div class="diff-line add">710733=Call her out! Tell her to come out!</div><div class="diff-line add">710734=Everything I'm suffering is because of her!</div><div class="diff-line add">710735=Your suffering is only because you let yourself fall into the abyss</div><div class="diff-line add">710736=Dragging others into the abyss doesn't change the fact that you're in it</div><div class="diff-line add">710737=That's easy for you to say. You're not the one being spurned.</div><div class="diff-line add">710738=Tell Palmer. I'll keep killing people until she comes to see me!</div><div class="diff-line add">710739=I will make those who betrayed and abandoned me pay with their blood!</div><div class="diff-line add">710740=(This is Eden.

My suffering must be shared!)</div><div class="diff-line add">710744=You again. Out of the way. Must I kill you?</div><div class="diff-line add">710745=Soros, stop it. It was our fault for leaving you behind.</div><div class="diff-line add">710746=But Eden was the last hope for mankind from Palmer.</div><div class="diff-line add">710747=If you destroy it, you will be the enemy of all the survivors!</div><div class="diff-line add">710748=It's not too late to stop!</div><div class="diff-line add">710749=Easy for you to say. Look at my gray-blue skin! Who would treat me as a human being?</div><div class="diff-line add">710750=The scared survivors want to get away from me, and no one will accept me!</div><div class="diff-line add">710751=But... Since you mentioned Palmer...</div><div class="diff-line add">710752=Then I'll kill your savior first, and give you all the sense of despair! Hahahahaha!</div><div class="diff-line add">710753=What should we do? Soros is going after Palmer.</div><div class="diff-line add">710754=Our job is to protect Eden.</div><div class="diff-line add">710755=The battle between Soros and Palmer is beyond our reach...</div><div class="diff-line add">710756=God, I just want it to end on a happy note.</div><div class="diff-line add">710757=(What should I do to draw Palmer out?)</div><div class="diff-line add">710758=(So far, she seems to have spoken of benevolence and compassion for the survivors.)</div><div class="diff-line add">710759=(Okay, then I'll give her a "good opportunity".)</div><div class="diff-line add">710760=Guess if your savior will be here on time? I'm really curious about it.</div><div class="diff-line add">710761=I heard you've saved a lot of people, the savior.</div><div class="diff-line add">710762=I heard you've killed a lot of people.</div><div class="diff-line add">710763=Yeah...I've killed a lot of people.

Vought's a bunch of evil tossers.</div><div class="diff-line add">711012=Homelander just saved our lives.</div><div class="diff-line add">711013=And nothing else happened, that was all?</div><div class="diff-line add">711014=One of the guards got caught in the crossfire.</div><div class="diff-line add">711015=But that was an accident.</div><div class="diff-line add">711016=Nothing is ever accidental with Homelander. We think he's trying to cover something up.</div><div class="diff-line add">711017=Have you got any evidence?</div><div class="diff-line add">711018=We're still working on it. Of course, it would be better if you could help us on this.</div><div class="diff-line add">711019=No problem! If Homelander and Vought have anything to do with this outbreak, we want to help you stop them.</div><div class="diff-line add">711020=Hey, guys! Check this out. The radar picked something up.</div><div class="diff-line add">711021=Well, we got ain't got all day. What is it?</div><div class="diff-line add">711022=I'm not totally sure. But it looks like a large building.</div><div class="diff-line add">711023=Can we trust this old piece of junk?</div><div class="diff-line add">711024=Holy-- That's where we saw all the Vought personnel.</div><div class="diff-line add">711025=If that's a Vought blacksite, then that's where we'll find the flying knobber.</div><div class="diff-line add">711026=What are we waiting for?</div><div class="diff-line add">711027=This is insane.</div><div class="diff-line add">711028=It's Vought, luv, what'd ya expect?</div><div class="diff-line add">711029=But what do we know for sure?</div><div class="diff-line add">711030=The intel shows the Vought experiments were not stable.</div><div class="diff-line add">711031=They were playing with fire.</div><div class="diff-line add">711032=You mean playing with toxic chemicals and unleashing an army of flesh eating dead kicking off an apocalypse?</div><div class="diff-line add">711033=But we don't know what ignited it. Keep working, guys. Clock's ticking.</div><div class="diff-line add">711034=Hey guys, look we got the coordinates.</div><div class="diff-line add">711035=Does this location look familiar to you, Natalie?</div><div class="diff-line add">711036=Wait--</div><div class="diff-line add">711037=That's Eden!</div><div class="diff-line add">711038=Oh my god. It actually does make sense in a way. I just can't believe it.</div><div class="diff-line add">711039=What? Spit it out luv.</div><div class="diff-line add">711040=Eden has been known as the safe haven, but that never made sense since the place was crawling with zombies.</div><div class="diff-line add">711041=We thought it was because of the survivors inside.</div><div class="diff-line add">711042=But now we know it's actually a secret Vought base.</div><div class="diff-line add">711043=If that means what I think it means--</div><div class="diff-line add">711044=Means we're heading straight into the belly of the beast.</div><div class="diff-line add">711045=How's Butcher?</div><div class="diff-line add">711046=I gave him the shot of Temp V.</div><div class="diff-line add">711047=How do you feel Butcher?</div><div class="diff-line add">711048=Brady and Natalie, thanks for helping us.</div><div class="diff-line add">711049=Oy, cut the lovey dovey pillow talk.

Just stay back!</div><div class="diff-line add">711052=Woah, that's dope, man!</div><div class="diff-line add">711053=Now we stand a chance against Homelander.</div><div class="diff-line add">711054=Homelander's indestructible. We need to avoid him at all costs</div><div class="diff-line add">711055=I still luv a chance to shove my crow bar where the sun don't shine.</div><div class="diff-line add">711056=Let's just try not to get ourselves killed.</div><div class="diff-line add">711057=Let's get ready and then head to Eden.</div><div class="diff-line add">711058=Are we all set?</div><div class="diff-line add">711059=Almost done. The radar shows Homelander is in Eden right now!</div><div class="diff-line add">711060=We gotta let the survivors in Eden get out first. We don't know what Homelander could do to them.</div><div class="diff-line add">711061=What survivors? If Eden's a lab for V, they're either zombies or dead.</div><div class="diff-line add">711062=Wait you guys, I just remembered there's a restricted underground area in Eden</div><div class="diff-line add">711063=Yeah, she's right. It was always totally inaccessible to the public.</div><div class="diff-line add">711064=Sounds like we found our X marks the spot.</div><div class="diff-line add">711065=Hang in there!!</div><div class="diff-line add">711066=Brady! I'm runnin' out of ammo. We need back up.

I'm not getting anything.</div><div class="diff-line add">711073=They told me the power would have been fixed already.</div><div class="diff-line add">711074=Damn it Hughie! Can't even handle a phone call….</div><div class="diff-line add">711075=Sorry about the delay. Power is coming back now.</div><div class="diff-line add">711076=We have the evidence. Vought's behind the outbreak.</div><div class="diff-line add">711077=Their Compound V experiments turned all the test subjects into zombies.</div><div class="diff-line add">711078=So what do we do now?</div><div class="diff-line add">711079=We go back to the fortress and grab every weapon we can.</div><div class="diff-line add">711080=Let's take 'em all dow.</div><div class="diff-line add">711081=Oh no…</div><div class="diff-line add">711082=Watch out!</div><div class="diff-line add">711083="Hang on, Butcher!"</div><div class="diff-line add">711084=This is it.</div><div class="diff-line add">711085=Time is ticking. Let’s spilt up.</div><div class="diff-line add">711086=Alright.</div><div class="diff-line add">711087=No time like the present to end this once and for all.</div><div class="diff-line add">711088=Oh another tough guy here. Who do you think you are?</div><div class="diff-line add">711089=The place is so creepy.</div><div class="diff-line add">711090=Yep. I feel so weird.</div><div class="diff-line add">711091=Look! Something's over there!</div><div class="diff-line add">711092=Watch out!</div><div class="diff-line add">711093=You hear that?</div><div class="diff-line add">711094=I think the sound is from somewhere there.</div><div class="diff-line add">711095=I can hear some heavy steps and low growls.</div><div class="diff-line add">711096=Looks like it's where classified files are stored.</div><div class="diff-line add">711097=That's the only clue we have so far.</div><div class="diff-line add">711098=Let's head down to check the floor below.</div><div class="diff-line add">711099=Here we are.</div><div class="diff-line add">711100=Time is ticking. Let’s split up.</div><div class="diff-line add">711101=Okay.</div><div class="diff-line add">711102=Look. Here are some supplies of Vought and samples from their failed experiments.</div><div class="diff-line add">711103=Which means what we found out before was true. Let's go find Starlight now!</div><div class="diff-line add">711104=Sure. No idea what's goin' on there.</div><div class="diff-line add">711105=What the f...</div><div class="diff-line add">711106=Annie January is as down-to-earth and sincere as they come. \nOriginally "The Defender of Des Moines", her dreams came true with a meteoric rise to The Seven. \nAll she's ever wanted to do is save the world--and while a lot of people say that as a corny catchphrase, she actually means it. \nBut her dream becomes her worst nightmare when she realizes The Seven is where good intentions go to die. \nSince then, Annie has teamed up with The Boys to take down Vought and reveal Homelander's sinister aims.</div><div class="diff-line add">711107=A former C.I.A. operative turned vigilante, Billy Butcher is as charming as he is cunning. He's a force of nature, who can talk almost anyone into anything, either through a smile or brute force - or sometimes both. He's consumed by one mission in life: to destroy superheroes and Vought. But this personal vendetta is driven by his hatred for one supe In particular: Homelander. Butcher's determined to get revenge on Homelander, no matter the cost. And he won't let anyone or anything stand in his way.</div><div class="diff-line add">711108=Hughie is an ordinary guy with an ordinary life until one day his girlfriend is tragically killed when A-Train, the speedster on The Seven, runs through his girlfriend. Desperate for justice, Hughie's recruited by anti-"supe"vigilante Billy Butcher, and Hughie's world is turned upside down when he learns superheroes are neither super nor heroic. But that doesn't stop Hughie from falling in love with Starlight. Their romance has its ups and downs but through it all, they remain committed to one another and their fight for decency.</div><div class="diff-line add">711109=The most powerful superhero the world has ever seen. Homelander boasts many powerful abilities, including flight, super strength, and super hearing. His x-ray vision allows him to see through nearly anything and destroy targets with his laser eyes. Homelander maintains the facade of the ultimate do-gooder, an all-American, God-fearing patriot. But the real Homelander, the one behind the movie star smile is vile, conniving, and ultimately sociopathic in his need for validation, love, and power.</div><div class="diff-line add">711110=Sounds like Vought.</div><div class="diff-line add">711111=Born poor on the mean streets of South Philadelphia, Soldier Boy learned the values of hard work, tenacity and bravery. He was VOUGHT's first and greatest Superhero, and was the former leader of the Superhero team Payback. But in 1984, Vought reported he died in a nuclear Power Plant meltdown. The truth of Soldier Boy's fate was not so simple. Previously, The Boys confronted Homelander at a secret Vought facility in Eden only to cause an explosion which disturbed a cryo chamber and awakening Soldier Boy from his long sleep.</div><div class="diff-line add">711112=A member of The Seven and the fastest man in the world! But underneath the cavalier exterior of a celebrity Superhero lies the soul of a mortal athlete with a deep insecurity about staying at the top. A-Train will do whatever it takes to remain in The Seven, because he knows it's only a matter of time until a younger, faster challenger takes his place -- and that's a problem even the fastest man in the world can't outrun.</div><div class="diff-line add">711117=Showdown with Homelander</div><div class="diff-line add">711118=We do need your radar to continue the investigation.</div><div class="diff-line add">711119=Event completed</div><div class="diff-line add">711120=Here's a room. It looks like a prison cell.</div><div class="diff-line add">711121=Anybody there? Help me!!</div><div class="diff-line add">711122=I heard someone's voice. Who's in there?</div><div class="diff-line add">711123=Thank goodness. Someone finally showed up! I thought I'm gonna die here alone.</div><div class="diff-line add">711124=Who are you? And why are you here?</div><div class="diff-line add">711125=I'm Alisa with the Minutemen. I'm held here by Zeus Group.</div><div class="diff-line add">711126=The badge on your outfit...I saw the same one before on Natalie. Anyway, why did they lock you up here?</div><div class="diff-line add">711127=Hmm...the lock is quite complicated. It takes at least &lt;color=#FD5E00&gt;4 keys&lt;/color&gt; to open it. Alisa, any idea where to find these keys?</div><div class="diff-line add">711128=Zeus Group usually keeps their important items in the &lt;color=#FD5E00&gt;Zeus Chests&lt;/color&gt;.</div><div class="diff-line add">711129=Given the chaotic situation, they might leave behind some of the chests.</div><div class="diff-line add">711130=Hope you can find the keys in the remaining chests.</div><div class="diff-line add">711131=Yep. I'll go find them.</div><div class="diff-line add">711132=I also need to get a few more helpers. The more hands we have, the better.</div><div class="diff-line add">711133=Keys, Zeus Chests... Ah! Now I remember!</div><div class="diff-line add">711134=I saw several &lt;color=#FD5E00&gt;chests left behind by Zeus Group&lt;/color&gt; just now. Do you think we should look into those chests?</div><div class="diff-line add">711135="Wandering around"... Fernando, I knew you were slacking off again!</div><div class="diff-line add">711136=Let's go have a look at the chest.</div><div class="diff-line add">711137=...defense protocol disabled</div><div class="diff-line add">711138=...alarm system disabled</div><div class="diff-line add">711139=...laser scanners deactivated</div><div class="diff-line add">711140=...the door is now open</div><div class="diff-line add">711141=It feels so good to be free again. I don't know how to thank you guys.</div><div class="diff-line add">711142=No worries. We gotta help each other in such an apocalyptic time.</div><div class="diff-line add">711143=My clothes are all stained by dirt. Please allow me to change into a more decent outfit first.</div><div class="diff-line add">711144=It's so refreshing in clean clothes. Let me introduce myself again. I'm Alisa from Minutemen.</div><div class="diff-line add">711145=Alisa, we are trying to rebuild this fortress, but there are too many things we do not know of.</div><div class="diff-line add">711146=I believe you know the place better. So we'd like to invite you to join us.</div><div class="diff-line add">711147=Sure! It's my pleasure!</div><div class="diff-line add">711148=In fact, apart from the human experiments, Zeus Group has &lt;color=#FD5E00&gt;a darker plan&lt;/color&gt;. The files are stored &lt;color=#FD5E00&gt;somewhere inside the fortress&lt;/color&gt;.</div><div class="diff-line add">711149=I'll show you all the secrets of the place if you are interested.</div><div class="diff-line add">711150=Great. Then what are we waiting for?</div><div class="diff-line add">711151=There's a &lt;color=#FD5E00&gt;access card&lt;/color&gt; inside the box. Looks like we can open one of the locks of the prison with it.</div><div class="diff-line add">711152=There's a &lt;color=#FD5E00&gt;Key Card&lt;/color&gt; inside the box. Looks like we can open one of the locks of the prison with it.</div><div class="diff-line add">711153=There's a &lt;color=#FD5E00&gt;police notebook&lt;/color&gt; in the box. On this page, it reads...&lt;color=#FD5E00&gt;2607&lt;/color&gt;... Is it a password?</div><div class="diff-line add">711154=There's a &lt;color=#FD5E00&gt;key&lt;/color&gt; inside the box. Looks like we can open one of the locks of the prison with it.</div><div class="diff-line add">711155=I was trying to stop Zeus Group's human experiments. Unluckily, I got caught. That's why I ended up here.</div><div class="diff-line add">711156=I see. Lemme see what I can do for ya.</div><div class="diff-line add">711157=This place is gonna blow!</div><div class="diff-line add">711158=Run!</div><div class="diff-line add">711159=PC in the Prison</div><div class="diff-line add">711160=Their experiments failed later, which led to leakage and contamination of the entire fortress. The prison thus became a safe haven.</div><div class="diff-line add">711161=The first lock is cracked... Do you know what business Zeus Group is doin'?</div><div class="diff-line add">711162=This lock is cracked as well... Why did they conduct those human experiments?</div><div class="diff-line add">711163=Looks like the code is correct... How did you make it to survive the confinement here for so long?</div><div class="diff-line add">711164=Looks like this is the last test.</div><div class="diff-line add">711165=It's a bio-research giant with tons of funds and advanced biotechs.</div><div class="diff-line add">711166=For profit, of course. They wish to work out a way to control zombies. A typical example of their "ambition."</div><div class="diff-line add">711167=That was a dark time, I have to say. You won't wanna know how exactly I survived...</div><div class="diff-line add">711168=Great. Finally, all this is coming to an end.</div><div class="diff-line add">711169=You need an idle worker to open the gate of the prison.</div><div class="diff-line add">711200=It’s been too long.</div><div class="diff-line add">711201=Thank God, you’re back.</div><div class="diff-line add">711202=And just in time for a little Christmas banger.</div><div class="diff-line add">711203=He’s kidding… I hope.</div><div class="diff-line add">711204=Who’s the new bird?</div><div class="diff-line add">711205=The name is Emma.</div><div class="diff-line add">711206=She’s an amazing reporter. She can help investigate anything suspicious about Vought.</div><div class="diff-line add">711207=We’ll see about that.</div><div class="diff-line add">711208=Can’t wait.</div><div class="diff-line add">711209=Guys, I just heard from a friend at a major news agency.</div><div class="diff-line add">711210=Vought is planning for a big announcement at the party.</div><div class="diff-line add">711211=Let’s split up to cover more ground.</div><div class="diff-line add">711212=I’ll go with you.</div><div class="diff-line add">711213=You’ll be recognized immediately.</div><div class="diff-line add">711214=Don’t you worry hun. I know how to stay hidden.</div><div class="diff-line add">711215=I’ll come too. It doesn’t hurt to have more firepower.</div><div class="diff-line add">711216=Homelander will spot you from a mile away. Let Natalie and I go in to investigate.</div><div class="diff-line add">711217=Fine, you’re right.</div><div class="diff-line add">711218=Annie and I will stay here to do some digging around.</div><div class="diff-line add">711219=Do you see that guy in green?</div><div class="diff-line add">711220=Is that who I think it is?</div><div class="diff-line add">711221=Butcher was right. Soldier Boy is very much alive.</div><div class="diff-line add">711222=How could he survive a nuclear incident?</div><div class="diff-line add">711223=Anyway, he’s here, meaning he’s not dead. And, more importantly.</div><div class="diff-line add">711224=we don’t know whose side he’s on.</div><div class="diff-line add">711225=We’d better go back and talk to Butcher.</div><div class="diff-line add">711226=Stay back. Homelander could spot you in a second. Just let me follow him.</div><div class="diff-line add">711227=Fine, but don’t be afraid to call for backup.</div><div class="diff-line add">711228=It looks like he lasered a whole perimeter around the party.</div><div class="diff-line add">711229=Like a ditch. Why would he do that?</div><div class="diff-line add">711230=Keeping the rotters out. He's up to something.</div><div class="diff-line add">711231=Butcher (on comms)</div><div class="diff-line add">711232=Wait. Homelander is talking to someone. Who’s the guy in blue?</div><div class="diff-line add">711233=I've taken a photo of him and am sending it to you now. Do you know who he is?</div><div class="diff-line add">711234=That’s A-Train, the fastest Supe in the world</div><div class="diff-line add">711235=Let’s go back and tell them what we’ve found out.</div><div class="diff-line add">711236=Have you found anything yet?</div><div class="diff-line add">711237=You think it’s that easy to hack Homelander's phone?</div><div class="diff-line add">711238=You’re supposed to be the expert hacker.</div><div class="diff-line add">711239=Oh! Here’s a message that reads “Operation Christmas Miracle will purge our PR problems…”</div><div class="diff-line add">711240=Operation Christmas Miracle?</div><div class="diff-line add">711241=That sounds ominous.</div><div class="diff-line add">711242=It’s Vought, when isn’t it ominous?</div><div class="diff-line add">711243=Homelander is trying to launch a “purge” on Christmas.</div><div class="diff-line add">711244=A purging of what?</div><div class="diff-line add">711245=We’re flying blind. We need more intel.</div><div class="diff-line add">711246=Shhhh. Look. Homelander is talking to Soldier Boy over there.</div><div class="diff-line add">711247=(This whole party is for you. To welcome the great Soldier Boy back.)</div><div class="diff-line add">711248=(Fancy lights, fireworks, cheers and fake Santa... that’s all you could do?)</div><div class="diff-line add">711249=(You need more? How about co-captain of The Seven?)</div><div class="diff-line add">711250=(I don’t share.)</div><div class="diff-line add">711251=(Fine, captain of the Seven is all yours.)</div><div class="diff-line add">711252=(Still feels like I’m getting stiffed.)</div><div class="diff-line add">711253=(C’mon. Family is meant to be together today…)</div><div class="diff-line add">711254=(Family! (laughs) That's a good one. Let’s just get this over with.)</div><div class="diff-line add">711255=So Soldier Boy knows what Vought has planned.</div><div class="diff-line add">711256=That’s our way in.</div><div class="diff-line add">711257=A-Train!</div><div class="diff-line add">711258=What are you doing here?</div><div class="diff-line add">711259=Look at this dynamic duo.</div><div class="diff-line add">711260=Please, help us. Before it’s too late.</div><div class="diff-line add">711261=Sorry, man. I really can’t.</div><div class="diff-line add">711262=Be selfless for once in your life.</div><div class="diff-line add">711263=(Murmuring) They’ll kick me out of The Seven if I tell you anything.</div><div class="diff-line add">711264=It’s worth it.</div><div class="diff-line add">711265=Just give us something.</div><div class="diff-line add">711266=If you don’t want to die, leave now.</div><div class="diff-line add">711267=Emma, it's your time to shine. Just approach him, slip him the earbud, and I'll handle the rest.</div><div class="diff-line add">711268=Copy that.</div><div class="diff-line add">711269=Soldier Boy. We got a diehard fan who would love to have a chat with you.</div><div class="diff-line add">711270=Unfortunately, he couldn't make it here but here's an earbud to speak with him.</div><div class="diff-line add">711271=Always happy to meet a fan.</div><div class="diff-line add">711272=It's been a right long time, Soldier Boy. Feels like a bloody eternity since we last crossed paths.</div><div class="diff-line add">711273=(Surprised) Butcher?</div><div class="diff-line add">711274=Now, let's cut to the chase.</div><div class="diff-line add">711275=We've got the lowdown on Vought's dirty little secret. What is Operation Christmas Miracle?</div><div class="diff-line add">711276=You're looking at the Christmas miracle.</div><div class="diff-line add">711277=They're setting you up to be the fall guy, you knobber.</div><div class="diff-line add">711278=Fall guy? For what?</div><div class="diff-line add">711279=Get rid of the people who know the truth, then Vought can make up the “truth” as they like.</div><div class="diff-line add">711280=Do you honestly want to sit on your arse to find out? Homelander will never let you be the captain of The Seven.</div><div class="diff-line add">711281=Holy hell, you’re right. Can't trust anyone with a cape.</div><div class="diff-line add">711282=Now you have another choice. Help us or let him win.</div><div class="diff-line add">711300=Hi, there! Reporter Emma has good news for you, Commander!</div><div class="diff-line add">711301=During the time you have been working with the heroes in the Fortress, have you ever wondered what they've been through in the past?</div><div class="diff-line add">711302=I've compiled some info I have gathered into profiles.</div><div class="diff-line add">711303=After reading the profiles, you'll get to know more about them!</div><div class="diff-line add">711304=Be sure to collect the reward after reading each profile!</div><div class="diff-line add">711305=Not having the hero yet. Cannot claim the biography reward.</div><div class="diff-line add">711306=Commander, you've unlocked the Ultimate Weapon system. Let's take a look at it now!</div><div class="diff-line add">711307=Tap the Ultimate Weapon tab to view all heroes who have their own Ultimate Weapons in your collection.</div><div class="diff-line add">711308=These are the heroes who have their Ultimate Weapons.

As to the Ultimate Weapons not unlocked yet, you will see their max-level attributes.</div><div class="diff-line add">711313=Ultimate Weapons have a new attribute, "Ultimate Weapon Energy".
