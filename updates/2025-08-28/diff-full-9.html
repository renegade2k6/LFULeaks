<div class="diff"><div class="diff-body"><div class="diff-line ctx">  246167=The fatal wounds are gunshot wounds! They were shot and killed...</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246168=It seems necessary to take the body back for a full examination!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246169=…Test results came back. It was a wound from the same gun. Shot at close range. Formed not more than 3 hours ago.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246170=In other words, the attackers have not gone far, we still have a chance to find them.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246171=Count me in. I will make these bastards pay!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246172=The target has been locked, but the risk factor in the area is high, and we need help.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246173=Guys, get ready to move — hey! Rebecca, don't be so mad!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246174=...Damn, they are also members of the Minutemen! This group of traitors, I'm gonna take them out myself!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246175=...6 killed and 4 ran away.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246176=This result has exceeded expectations. Don't just chase after the enemy, but also pay attention to supplies.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246177=Can anyone tell me what happened to the zombies all over the floor?!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246178=Looks like we're being set up. Let's find a way out of this!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246179=Target is in range.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246180=Good, ready to fire!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246181=2 killed themselves, and the rest were killed.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246182=Copy that! But I always felt something was wrong...just to be safe, prepare to retreat!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246183=We got something! A geologist named Diana called us for help.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246184=Diana? Before the castle community fell, the platoon commander sent her to investigate a piece of mineral that is claimed to be related to the zombie virus.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246185=In other words, maybe she can help us solve the mystery of zombies!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246186=Ha, this is interesting! There are ruins everywhere, I think Diana might need an excavator more than us.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246187=So you can't work alone — Hey! Diana! Can you hear me?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246188=...I'm in the innermost room, there are a few zombies outside, and I'm afraid to come out.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246189=You did very well! Hold on, let us give the zombies!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246190=Oh, god, thank you! thank you all……</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246191=Don't be afraid, it's okay, we will take you to an absolutely safe place.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246192=What do you say about that mineral? I remember on the run, I put it right in the EdenCorp's building.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246193=EdenCorp? This is arguably the most iconic building in the neighborhood. Let's go.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246194=It's unbelievable! The community's largest EdenCorp is so desolate......</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246195=Now is not the time to sigh! There is a dangerous atmosphere here. It's best not to let your guard down.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246196=I nearly got scared me to death by all the Zombies that came out of nowhere!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246197=Shut up, you stupid pig, any more calls will draw more zombies over!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246198=Stop arguing, I have already looked for it, the mineral is not here. Let's go back and talk about it!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246199=The mineral is gone? How? I put it in the EdenCorp...</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246200=Someone should have taken the mineral, and We found traces of it at the scene.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246201=The results are in. The men who took the ore should not have gone far and now there is still time to chase them.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246202=Wow! I saw them! Get ready!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246203=Be quiet, there are more enemies than expected, don't alert them!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246204=I'm afraid it's too late! They've found us. Prepare to break out!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246205=Aftet the number of people was counted, the entire population was successfully evacuated, without loss of life or injury.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246206=No! I'm shot! I got shot in the ass! !!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246207=All right buddy, it's just a scratch. We gotta get back.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246208=These people are well-equipped and well-trained. To be honest, I can’t even imagine where they came from?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246209=I'm sure they had something to do with the Zombie attack. Now that their car is broken, we must not miss this opportunity!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246210=According to the radar, they will enter this area in 10 minutes.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246211=Ha ha! I feel enthusiastic! Wait till you see this genius!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246212=Come on, boy, I look forward to your performance, don't let me down!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246213=These bastards destroyed the mineral before killing themselves. Damn, the clue is broken again!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246214=Don't be too upset. At least we figured out who the enemy is.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246215=Yeah, the uniforms and logos they hid under their coats...They must be from EdenCorp!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246216=Guys, the radar has captured new signals! A group of survivors.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246217=Probably escaped from the castle community, too. There's no other living community around here.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246218=Get ready to go. We'll have a new partner again!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246219=There was one missing when counting the number of people just now. It was a young man named Jack Chang!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246220=Jack Chang? ! We have been looking for this guy for some time!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246221=Those survivors said that he was just a courier. Why did you minutemen want him for?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246222=It's a long story. Anyway, he accidentally took away a piece of intel, and if he finds it, he might be able to find out what happened to the community.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246223=Among the survivors who were rescued, someone said they saw Jack Chang leave alone two hours ago, heading southeast.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246224=He can't go far in this short time. Natalie, can you find out where he is?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246225=No problem-the target is successfully locked.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246226=Dont kill me! Dont kill me! Please!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246227=Don't be afraid, we are here to save you... You mean someone's after you?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246228=Yes... please, help me!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246229=Don't worry, we will protect you, so let's go back to the Fortress first!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246230=The intel is in that letter? God, no wonder the people from EdenCorp are after me...</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246231=EdenCorp? Are you sure you read it right?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246232=Wrong? How can it be! I saw them wearing EdenCorp uniforms with my own eyes!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246233=Listen, I almost got killed! That's why I hid myself!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246234=All right! Relax, you are safe, let us prepare a surprise for EdenCorp!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246235=I found that there were some gunmen from the EdenCorp, and they seemed to be looking for something.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246236=It's a rare opportunity to say hello to them!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246237=A big win! How about opening a bottle of champagne to celebrate?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246238=Don't be too happy. Those were just cannon fodder!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246239=The point is, we didn't get the intel either.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246240=I detected their movement, about 5km northeast.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246241=Save the champagne until next time! Ready to go, guys!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246242=These killers are suicidal, and the clue is broken again!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246243=There may be clues on the corpse. Let's take them home!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246244=The opportunity to open the champagne is gone, and the killers destroyed the intel before they killed themselves, and we're all out.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246245=But at least it proves that it's got something to do with EdenCorp, and sooner or later they will show the fox tail!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246246=Found a ground warehouse, there should be a lot of supplies.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246247=It's time for action!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246248=I found a letter left by a farmer named Harrison, who had taken refuge here and left here a few hours ago.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246249=Harrison? Then we can celebrate together, guys!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246250=Just a farmer, what's to celebrate?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246251=If I remember correctly, before the castle community fell, Harrison seemed to be a supplier to the EdenCorp?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246252=Bingo! So Harrison is very important to us.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246253=Found it! Harrison is about 15 km northwest.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246254=The area is packed with zombies. Hurry up! We must save Harrison!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246255=It seems that there are no zombies here, please search carefully!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246256=No? Is all this a conspiracy of the EdenCorp?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246257=It's just speculation at the moment, but all clues point to EdenCorp.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246258=The EdenCorp said before that it would send someone to pick me up...God! Do they want to kill me?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246259=I’m afraid you’re right, but don’t worry, we will treat them well!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246260=This is the place where EdenCorp and Harrison will meet. Get ready for ambush!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246261=Let's hope it doesn't become another war of annihilation — at least let me get one alive.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246262=If you learn to fight, you can't catch a bullet.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246263=You are right this time—Attention, there is movement ahead!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246264=Can anyone tell me what the meaning of this battle is? How many zombies to kill? Where are the people from EdenCorp?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246265=I guess they didn't plan to come! Lenovo’s previous community fell, maybe they have mastered the ability to control zombies...</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246266=Well, the usual topic! But even if this is true, the manipulator cannot stay away from the battlefield-in other words, the enemy is still nearby!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246267=Hey, Brady, there are some sneaky guys in my scope, can I shoot?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246268=Sure! But again, if you want to catch them alive, don't aim their head!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246269=These guys are really scary, they would rather kill themselves rather than surrender! Are they brainwashed by EdenCorp?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246270=But they can't destroy all the clues, at least we know that EdenCorp does have a way to control the zombies.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246271=Attention. A gardener called Lafite Marceau is calling for help. At a place where used to be a plantation.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246272=A plantation? If I remember correctly, that's where EdenCorp is located. That is to say...</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246273=Let's check it out then. Let's go, buds!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246274=Oh, geez! Look at that. The place is like ten times the size of a soccer field! It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246275=Alright. No time for complaining. Don't forget Lafite is still waiting for us. Let's split up and look for her.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246276=Thank you so much! I thought I was gonna die.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246277=All is over now. We'll take you to somewhere absolutely safe.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246278=Here's what happened. EdenCorp asked me to cultivate a new plant. Then the "castle" was fallen. I was thus stuck in the plantation.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246279=The plant... Do you still have any of it?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246280=No. The place was destroyed by Zombies. But EdenCorp would transport some plants to the bio base regularly. You may take your chances there.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246281=The place is more like a zombie base than a bio base... I can even hear the Zombies growling in there!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246282=Looks like EdenCorp already gave up on the place. Hope they at least secured the plants Lafite grew.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246283=That is. The plant! Well done, buds!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246284=Thanks. Lafite, please continue your research. We need to figure out what's behind all this.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246285=I need some special fertilizers. Without them, the plants won't grow. Well, the thing is, the fertilizers were all taken away by EdenCorp.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246286=Umm... That's a real issue. I remember there's a barn behind the bio base. Let's see if we can find any there.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246287=Over there is the barn of EdenCorp.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246288=Much larger than I thought, but looks long abandoned.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246289=Be careful. We'll split up after getting in.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246290=Oops. It's not our lucky day today. There's nothing in there!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246291=Check out the footprint. The color of the dirt is different from the soil around here. Take some and go back to analyze it.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246292=We got the result for the dirt on the footprint! There's only one area nearby that has soil like this.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246293=Good job. Locate where it is. Get ready to go!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246294=A warehouse. The fertilizer should be in there. Telling from the growl, there're quite a lot of Zombies inside.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246295=Time to flex my muscles. We've been tackling EdenCorp for a while. Can't wait to see how they beg for pardon after tasting my fists.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246296=Bravo! Then I'll be able to continue with my cultivation experiment!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246297=We'll count on you, Lafite. Bring back the good news.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246298=Got a message from Rebecca on wireless. She's calling for help.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246299=What the heck with the woman? She's been out on patrol for no more than two hours!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246300=Perhaps she's in trouble, or found out something. Anyway, let's go find her.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246301=You really gotta fix the 80-year-old car. I've been waiting for a good 4 hours!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246302=This is the first time I see you in such a mess. Tell me what happened.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246303=I'll tell you when we go back. Now help me handle the killers of EdenCorp first.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246304=So you were attacked while searching the abandoned warehouse of EdenCorp? That's weird.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246305=God knows what these bastards are up to. Almost lost my life there!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246306=Simply complaining won't change anything. Come on, let's go teach them a lesson.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246307=Target is in range!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246308=Hey, Rebecca. Now it's time to let them know what it means to act against us.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246309=Copy that! One shot, one kill. None of them is gonna get away!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246310=Brady, why the grim look? What's up?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246311=I was looking into the movement of EdenCorp. They might have a stronghold not far from here.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246312=If it's not far, we might try to find where it is.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246313=See? That's the stronghold of EdenCorp. We may move anytime.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246314=Then what are we waiting for? Go get it, buds!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246315=Heh, Fernando. Why you got so excited? Are you gonna take the lead?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246316=Stop kidding me! I mean, don't you see Natalie and Rebecca are ready to have a good fight?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246317=From what we got this time, we can see EdenCorp was aiming at the abandoned warehouse. There must be something important in there.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246318=Looks like it's long abandoned. Not likely to find anybody there.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246319=Indeed. That's why it seems so unusual that EdenCorp is interested in a place like this.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246320=Hey, everybody! I'm Mario, a plumber. Are you here to save me?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246321=Save you? Wait! Where did this... Mr. Chubby come from? Almost scared the shit out of me... Heh, stop looking at me like that, Fernando. I wasn't calling you!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246322=Alright. Enough. Mario, how we are going to treat you depends on who you are and what you want.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246323=I guess you will be happy to leave with us.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246324=Of course. The first time I saw you, I knew you were not bad guys!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246325=Thank you for saving my life. When I was working in the warehouse, a horde of zombies gathered outside. I got no where to go but to stay here. EdenCorp once came here, but those idiots left me here like this!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246326=What did they do here?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246327=They took away something. I begged them to save me. Never expected that they began to shoot at me! These bastards! Luckily, a lady with you distracted them from here.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246328=I see. We got here too late. Don't worry. We'll make EdenCorp pay for what they did to you.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246329=Someone responded to my radio transmissions. 20 km in NW. Isn't that an empty space? Weird...</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246330=Perhaps that's someone like you. Out on a mission before the "castle" was fallen.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246331=Make sense. Hope the guy is one of us. But if it's someone with EdenCorp, I would get even more excited.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246332=Not a bird can be seen within like 5 km. Are we at the right place?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246333=Look at these traces! Someone just left. We'd better run a search carefully.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246334=Search around with the Radar as well. No more than 3 hours have passed since we received the signal. The sender must be around.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246335=I got something. The sender is in the north. 12 o'clock.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246336=Look. A fainted woman over there! And...oh, no! Some Zombies moving towards her.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246337=Oh... You attracted those brainless things towards this way. Good one, mate! Since when did you begin to do things smartly?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246338=Ahem... Ha-ha, "smart" is my middle name!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246339=I just got out of EdenCorp. Those people are like ten times scary than Zombies.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246340=Yup. No doubt about it. The thing is... Why they are after you?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246341=For my patent! I'm a breeding expert. EdenCorp wanted to have my breeding techs and I refused them. That's why they were trying to "solve the problem" in another way.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246342=Where did they hold you? Don't worry. We'll get you out of the trouble.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246343=Over there is the stronghold of EdenCorp. Get ready, fighters!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246344=Same plan. You and me, each taking a squad. One from the front. The other from the back. Let's move.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246345=Aha! A complete success! We smashed the headquarters of EdenCorp.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246346=Things are not that simple. Telling from the size, it was more of a temporary stronghold.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246347=Based on what EdenCorp usually does, they haven't got what they want if they let Elena live till today.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246348=Exactly. I put the lab log they want in a hidden place.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246349=If you don't mind, we can get it for you.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246350=This is where Elena left her log? Can there be more zombies?! How did she put it in?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246351=There might not be so many Zombies in the past. Anyway, clean them up first.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246352=That's it! Thank god, it's still good as new. I owe you much, guys!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246353=What's exactly in it? Sorry, I have to know the answer, cuz it has something to do with the lives of all of us.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246354=I understand. You're my life saviors, after all. This is the bio-genetic technology. Here you are.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246355=Bio-genetics... Continue the research, Elena. I believe it's gonna be of great use in the near future!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246356=Got another distress signal. Wait... It's from EdenCorp?!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246357=EdenCorp? My dear sniper, you did read the info accurately, didn't you?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246358=Let's check it out then. Isn't this what we've been expecting? Let's go!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246359=You sure someone's in there? It's only an abandoned warehouse.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246360=Shush... You hear that?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246361=Right behind the door. Looks like someone's locked inside.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246362=Let's get closer. Be careful.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246363=Thank you so much, guys! You were right. EdenCorp was the one who made the Zombie virus.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246364=Tell me. Why did they do this? What exactly do they want?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246365=Sorry. I wish I knew the answer. But I'm only an ordinary worker there. I don't know much about the scheme.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246366=But I heard that the one who initiated the project was Dr. Luke. Yet he was against what EdenCorp was doing and left it later.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246367=Dr. Luke? Where did he go?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246368=No idea. But I overheard earlier he had been held at a waste recycling station not long before he disappeared. You might find some clues there.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246369=Here we are. Dirty and smelly! Looks like it really is a waste recycling station.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246370=Yup. The smell alone is a no-no for me.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246371=Alright, guys. Not the time for complaining yet. Let's get down to business.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246372=From the intel we got at the waste recycling station, there should be a stronghold of EdenCorp somewhere around 20 km away. Natalie, I need more info on it.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246373=On it.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246374=What? This is the so-called stronghold? EdenCorp is short of money or what?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246375=Don't underestimate it. The defense here is pretty solid.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246376=Be careful with every move. Don't let them run away easily.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246377=From what we got so far, EdenCorp already knew where the notes were. We gotta take the notes before they do.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246378=Look at there! Ah... We're busted. EdenCorp is quicker than we are.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246379=They are here for the notes of Dr. Luke, too. Don't let them have the notes. Let's move!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246380=What we do now? The notes must have been taken away by EdenCorp.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246381=I don't think so. If EdenCorp got the notes, there will not be this many guards outside a useless stronghold. Obviously, they did not find it that easily.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246382=Make sense. What are we supposed to do?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246383=Simply wait for the right timing. With Bonnie, it'll be much easier to find the HQ of EdenCorp.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246384=The signal is from EdenCorp? You sure, Bonnie?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246385=100% sure. I was there for over six months.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246386=Alright, buds. Take your arms and go!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246387=This is the stronghold of EdenCorp? Don't you find it a little bit... creepy?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246388=Based on rough estimate, there're around twenty armed guards. We can take down them all.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246389=Great. Then surprise time!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246390=From what we found, EdenCorp is looking for a woman called Cara. Any idea who she could be?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246391=Cara? Never heard of the name.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246392=Found it! Cara was a farmer, and a former supplier for EdenCorp.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246393=Supplier? There must be something we don't know. We gotta find Cara before EdenCorp does!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246394=It should be here. I can see the guards of EdenCorp from the binoculars.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246395=So we attack now? My gun is thirsty for something juicy and red.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246396=I'm afraid you need to hold on a while. We're here to save Cara. First make sure whether she's safe.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246397=Natalie, come with me to get in. Rebecca, cover us.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246398=Th...thank you. They held me there for days to find where Dr. Luke is. Can't imagine how they're gonna torture me next.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246399=You know where he is?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246400=No. But I was the one who took care of him. He once gave me a notebook with his researches in it. The thing seems to be very important to EdenCorp.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246401=!!! Can we have the notes? Trust me, it's important for us.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246402=That's what the people from EdenCorp said. But I could tell they were not gonna do anything good with it, so I made up a lie. This time, I'll tell you where it is.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246403=Is this the place, Cara?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246404=Yup. But looks like someone's been here. Weird...</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246405=I noticed that as well. That is to say...</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246406=Let's look around first. Hope things are not that bad.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246407=Looks like EdenCorp already took away the notes. We're late again!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246408=They can't be far from here. Locate them with the Radar.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246409=Found their vehicles. 40 km away. 12 o'clock. Heading north at full speed.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246410=Let's go. Do not let them go this time!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246411=About 15 min ago, EdenCorp's vehicles entered the Facility.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246412=Attack now! Find the notes of Dr. Luke as quickly as you can!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246413=Now we know what's going on. EdenCorp was trying to control the world with the genetic agent "Eve." But what they actually made was the zombie virus.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246414=Worse still, they pretended to be innocent and lived with us like that in "castle."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246415=We shall not stand by. They must pay for what they did.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246416=Dr. Luke's notes say, the headquarters of Eden is at somewhere remote. The few of us are far from enough to handle them.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246417=Brady, do you mean...?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246418=We'll disclose the truth and let other survivors out there know. The Minutemen, Vindicators and Wildlings... Count them in for this ultimate battle!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246419=No one knows what's gonna happen next. But there's one thing we know for sure -- we are about to usher in a new era!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246420=Calm down. Their wounds are weird. Better check it out.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246421=I bet she can't hear it. What about one month's ration of Sizzling Gophers as the stake?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246422=Let's go, buds! After this, I'll buy you roasted Gophers, as much as you want!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246423=Copy that. I'll locate where it is as fast as possible.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246424=Wooo! It's gonna be the war to end all wars?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246425=Glad to know you feel that way, Mr. Brom. Welcome!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246426=Thanks, I am more concerned about what you need me to do. I used to be a mercenary.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246427=It's clear that one can't survive without some skills these days.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246428=There are still many secrets hidden here. We need people like you to explore them with us.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246429=I'll leave the trap here and go have a rest. Hope I could see a Gopher in the trap tomorrow morning.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246430=Now we have workers in the Mine. We'll be able to collect some Stones tomorrow. Now we may go have a rest.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  246431=Place the Mushroom Box here and go get some sleep. We'll have enough food to eat tomorrow.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  247001=Check out what I found! There's a garage right under the Entrance Hall!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  247002=Looks like it'll need some repairs though.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  247003=Consider it done!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  247004=Heavens, what's that piled up over there?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  247005=Visitor detected. Diagnostics mode activated.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  247006=30%......57%......scan complete. Damage report: 23% of core energy remaining......low battery mode activated.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  247007=It's a robot!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  247008=N.A.T.E at your service. I can do tasks, such as gathering, distributing, storage, and many more.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  247009=Last activation for service. 5000 hours ago. Service target......Error. Data lost.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  247010=Don't worry buddy. This is your new home now. Welcome!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  247011=Hard to believe such a small machine can carry that many supplies.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  247012=Hear that N.A.T.E? The ever-so spiteful Emma is actually complimenting y—N.A.T.E!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  247013=N.A.T.E! Oh no, it shut off! Poor buddy...</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  247014=Don't worry, it's just out of power. It'll be back up and running again when we find a way to power him up.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  247015=I hope that day comes soon!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  247016=Our Heroes are short of soldiers. Please replenish more.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  247017=Facing the strong enemy, we need to ensure that each Hero leads at least one soldier.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  247018=Replenish soldiers and get prepared.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  247019=There're toxic gases and pollution everywhere. We'd better be careful with every step we take.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  247020=Same strategy. We move towards Eden inch by inch.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  247021=I got a file here. Perhaps we can find some clues in it.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  247022=Looks like these are some survival experience left by someone.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  247023=We need to capture a Lv. 1 city first. Then capture more territories and move towards Eden little by little.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  247024=Maybe we can build some Facilities out of these minerals to shield us from the pollution, and keep our territory connected.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  247025=Tap to view rules on other pages.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  247026=Tap here to close the rule page</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  247027=After figuring out how to play, let's get started in the new season!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248001=I saw someone special at the door.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248002=Special? How special?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248003=With no gun, the guy blew a zombie's head off with bare fists.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248004=Check if he got other weapons. Then bring him to me.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248005=Hey, guys... Fernando? You're alive?! Thought you already turned into one of those things!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248006=You bastard, Beesly! Who do you think I am?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248007=You know him? Who is he, Fernando?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248008=An old villain. Messing around and scamming people everywhere.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248009=Heh. C'mon. I wasn't that bad. I used to be a boxing coach.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248010=Yep. Boxing coach! The one who ran away with all my money for "boxing lessons."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248011=Wait, did I? There must be something wrong. I'll give you back all your money and interests. I promise!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248012=Welcome, Laura. May I know what you did in the past for a living?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248013=I used to work for a logistics company. I also have a van. Glad to lend a hand if you need help.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248016=Which is to say, we can go back to the ground more often?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248017=Of course, Fernando.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248018=Thanks, Laura. We'll count on you to collect resources up there.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248019=Thank you for opening the door for me. You really saved my life.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248020=Don't be so modest. A couple of zombies like that ain't a problem for you. Are they, Ms. Sharpshooter?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248021=Do I know you?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248022=We're actually from the same area. Heard of your name years ago. After all, everyone knew we had a shooting champion.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248023=That's right, Pamela. I even have your autograph!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248024=Alright. But that was really a close one. I got only one bullet left.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248025=Haha. No need to worry about that here. Are you interested in being our coach for shooting?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248026=With pleasure.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248027=Voila. This is the Fortress. How do you think, Fiona?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248028=Not bad. The place's much better than the warehouse.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248029=Trust me. The longer you stay here, the more you'll like it.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248030=So, let's get down to business. What do you need from me?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248031=Alright. As you can see, we're expanding the place at the moment...</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248032=Simply put, we need you to do what you did when training the Minutemen.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248033=Sure. But to be frank, my way of training is way beyond what is called "cruel."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248034=I see. You may adopt whatever training you want, so long as we have good fighters.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248035=Morning, guys!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248036=Geez! Where did she come from?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248037=Who are you?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248038=Forgot my voice already? We had a satellite call last night!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248039=That can't be real! You were like 20 km away when calling. We planned to rescue you early this morning.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248040=I would say I'm much stronger than you thought. As a fitness coach, I would never be dwarfed by half a marathon.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248041=On another note, you really gotta check out the security issue. No one saw me while I tried to get in.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248042=That's because zombies, generally speaking, cannot get over the wall.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248043=Tell me you don't really think zombie is your only enemy, sweetheart.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248044=Remember, in the post-apocalypse world, humans can be more dreadful than zombies.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  248045=Well.

Worse still, there were few days when she was not beaten by him. The miserable childhood made her who she was, cold and inapproachable.\nBy the time the zombie virus broke out, Rebecca was only 5 years old. Too young to survive alone, she had to seek a shelter with her stepfather. After years of turmoil, she came across a crucial opportunity. In an unexpected siege by zombies, she was found and rescued by the Minutemen led by Benson. They brought her back to the "castle", a place where humans dwelt. To her amazement, her stepfather did something unusual at the critical moment -- he created an opportunity for the Minutemen to save Rebecca at the price of his own life. And so, he devoted the last few minutes of his life to the salvation of her daughter.\nAfter arriving at the "castle", Rebecca learnt how to shoot with the help of Benson. Her talent in shooting was rare but visible. That's why she was soon accepted as a member of the Minutemen. In a few years' time, Rebecca made it to become an outstanding sniper. With numerous contribution she made, she was promoted to Major at a young age. Impressed by her unparalleled skills and mysterious personality, everyone around her treated her with respect and admiration.\nOn the very day the "castle" fell, Rebecca was outside, leading her team on a mission. By the time she came back, the "castle" was already gone. Left with no other choice, Rebecca led the team to shift from one shelter to another, while searching for other people who got out of the "castle."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251001=[Profile]\nFaction: To be unveiled\nProfession: To be unveiled\nSex: To be unveiled\nAge: To be unveiled\nHeight: To be unveiled\nWeight: To be unveiled\nNationality: To be unveiled\nBlood Type: To be unveiled\nBirthday: To be unveiled\n[Experience]\nTo be unveiled</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251002=Profile\nFaction: Solari\nProfession: Geologist\nSex: F\nAge: 36\nHeight: 165 cm\nWeight: 54 kg\nNationality: American\nBlood Type: A\nBirthday: June 20\nExperience\nBorn in Los Angeles, in a family of intellectuals, both her parents were geology professors in a well-known university. With their guidance and help, Diana began her journey in geology from an early age. When she was 16, the zombie crisis broke out. Luckily, Diana's family was under special protection from the government. After the government collapsed, they were escorted by the army to the dwelling of humans, the "castle." In the first few years, her parents were not treated well, for geology was considered useless in the doomsday and the management there was completely a mess. Forced to do all sorts of manual labor to make ends meet, they both died of illness within a few years.\nAfter that, as the resources were running low, the management finally realized that they had to expand their living space and began to look for experts in geology. That's when Diana was chosen as a geology consultant, responsible for the survey of underground resources and the excavation plan. With outstanding talent and years of study, Diana got her work done well with ease, earning a good salary with excellent performance. Later, she gained more respect and played an indispensable role there.\nHalf a month before the fall of the "castle", Diana was commissioned by the leader of the Minutemen, Benson, to help him study an ore of unknown origin. Before the results of the research could be obtained, the "castle" fell under the onslaught of the zombie wave. Diana escaped under the protection of the Minutemen. On the way out, she hid the ore in an office of EdenCorp she passed by to lessen the burden. In the end, she managed to get rid of the zombies, but somehow lost contact with the soldiers protecting her all the way.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251003=Profile\nFaction: Solari\nProfession: Courier\nSex: M\nAge: 22\nHeight: 170 cm\nWeight: 67 kg\nNationality: American\nBlood Type: B\nBirthday: April 14\nExperience\nJack was born in an ordinary family in Indiana.

He was then brought to the dwelling of humans, the "castle", where he was raised and cared for years. There, Jack received rigorous military training and got to know several members of the Minutemen. When he grew up, however, he chose to be a courier instead of following his uncle's arrangement to join the Minutemen.\nBefore the fall of "castle", Jack was accidentally involved in an issue, and nearly lost his life in it. It all started from the confidential intel stolen by Major Bolton of the Minutemen from EdenCorp. To keep it safe, he gave the intel to Jack without much explanation, and asked him to pass it to Benson. Not knowing how important the file was, Jack accidentally mixed the intel with other parcels. He thus became the target hunted by EdenCorp. With the skills and nimble mind he had developed during his years with the Minutemen, Jack made it to get back from the death's door several times. Unfortunately, the zombie wave broke through the defense of the Minutemen. And so the "castle" fell. Jack was not able to find Benson amid the chaos. Instead, he went all the way to the west with other survivors.

He had a failed marriage. His wife left him and took away his only daughter. Devastated and disheartened, Harrison has since devoted all his energy to his business and stayed single till now.\nIn 1992, the zombie crisis broke out. The 35 year old Harrison was driving to the city his ex-wife was in to deliver goods. At that time, a horde of zombies were flooding into the city. To protect his daughter, he drove to his ex-wife's house, only to find she and her current husband had already turned into zombies. He had no choice but to shoot them dead. The bad news was his daughter was missing. To find his daughter, Harrison made up his mind and rushed out onto the street. He found nothing and was unluckily caught in the middle of a horde of zombies. The moment he thought he was so dead, an army arrived in time and saved him. He followed the army all the way to the dwelling of humans, the "castle." Until then, he still could not find his daughter.\nTo search for his daughter, Harrison volunteered to join the Minutemen. Due to the irreversible damage caused by his previous injury, he failed to pass the physical test. In the end, he had to take up his old job -- farming. Later, he became a major supplier, and established partnership with the top business there -- EdenCorp. Harrison did not give up the hope to find his daughter. He told the Minutemen the basic info about his daughter and asked them for help when they went out on rescue missions. Although he knew there was little hope, he never gave up. Every now and then, he would go to the headquarters of the Minutemen to ask if there was any news about her.\nHis action, however, was misinterpreted by EdenCorp. Due to an info theft incident recently, it began a screening of partners. Harrison, as a supplier to the company, was listed as a major suspect for having private connections with the Minutemen. The poor Harrison was not aware of it at all. When the "castle" fell, Harrison escaped amid the chaos and hid in a warehouse. He found some communications equipment in there.

Under the influence of her family, she became a famous pharmacist at a young age. At the wake of the zombie crisis, the governments of all countries were trying to find a miracle cure to the zombie virus. As an expert in medicine, Lafite was invited by the government to do relevant researches. As a result, among many experts, she was the only one who developed the medicine to slow down the transformation process of the infected. Because of the great achievement, the government rewarded her and gave her special protection. After the government collapsed, a special force that protected her escorted her to the dwelling of humans, the "castle."\nLater, most people were convinced that there's no cure to the zombie virus. Lafite also gave up her research and began growing herbs, to heal the residents and cope with the drug shortage issue. She reaped a lot of wealth from the business and gained popularity among residents. Even the top business EdenCorp approached her, offering her a high price to develop a new drug. Lafite agreed instantly and began working on it soon.\nDuring this period, however, she found that the material provided by EdenCorp contained a special element, which was extremely similar to the zombie virus she once studied. She was taken aback by the finding. She then realized she was in a big trouble. After thinking it over, she decided not to tell anyone about the issue. Yet, she tried to delay the development of the drug. Every time she handled the results to EdenCorp, she would claim the research was still ongoing. She thought this would keep EdenCorp from taking notice. Just then, a wave of zombies overwhelmed the "castle" overnight.

From a young age, his dream was to become a movie star and he made his way to the US at the age of 20 to realize his dream in Hollywood. However, without the support of his family, he quickly found himself to be completely broke and had no choice but to work as a plumber to get by. This did not stop him as he continued to look for opportunities at the filming studios during his free time. Though he was unsuccessful in gaining the favor of any directors, he was still able to land roles as a background artist on several occasions.\nA few years later, the first zombie viruses struck. People haven't realized the severity of it due to it being in the preliminary stages. The media, on the other hand, made a big deal out of it and as a result, zombie movies became a popular genre. Mario landed a role in one of the zombie movies as the leader of a team of survivors. Unfortunately, on the day of the shoot, someone really did turn into a zombie at the studio and the filming venue fell into chaos almost immediately. Mario was lucky and made it out safely, he arrived at the streets outside to find more and more zombies and masses of people running for their lives. In the midst of chaos, he joins a team of survivors and miraculously continued to "play" his role as the leader of the team. He displayed astounding reasoning and reliability which earned the respect of the others and became a recognized leader. Under Mario's leadership, they first secured a number of firearms in the nearby police station, then they proceeded to the supermarket to scavenge for food and essential supplies. After the critical items have been secured, they began an escape on foot that went on for several months. Their journey was filled with danger and members continued to fall. They faced numerous dire situations, but Mario still managed to lead the team through the challenges and successfully reached "Castle," a human society. Only then, did Mario free himself of his "role" and discard his courage and confidence as he behaved like a complete coward at the praise and invitation of the society executives and the Minuteman.\nAfterwards, Mario continued his old trade of being a plumber and hid away his dream of becoming a movie star in the face of the arrival of the apocalypse. It remained the same way as many years passed by, until one day, as Mario was fixing the sewage pipes for Eden Corp., the largest corporation in the community, he heard a loud bang from the outside. The familiar sound of zombies roaring and people screaming filled his ears. He peeked through the crack in the pipes to see the one scene he never wished to see again. After twenty years of safety and peace, the society of the living was finally overrun by the zombies! However, this time Mario no longer possesses the courage nor the script to face the zombies once again and all he could do was to curl up helplessly in the darkness of the dark sewers...</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251007=[Profile]\nFaction: Solari\nProfession: Breeder\nSex: F\nAge: 25\nHeight: 170 cm\nWeight: 53 kg\nNationality: Canadian\nBlood Type: B\nBirthday: April 20\n[Experience]\nBorn in Montreal, Canada, to a family of researchers.

Elena's parents both sacrificed themselves to protect her and she was rescued by an airport security personnel named Coleman. After a few twists and turns of events, she found herself in "Castle," society of the living, and grew up under Coleman's care.\nGrowing up, Elena displayed a strong interest and talent towards breeding animals. She found a job being a breeder and became a professional breeder without any guidance. Eden Corp. was interested in her ability and extended numerous invitations to Elena. Unfortunately, these invitations were all rejected because seeing Eden Corp. reminds Elena of their tragic deaths.\nHowever, this did not mean the end to Eden Corp's efforts. They secretly sent agents to kidnap Elena and shipped her out of the society of the living and locked her up in one of their facilities in the outside world. They forced Elena to work for them, there was no way for her to retaliate so she had no choice but to comply, but little did she know, what they wanted her to breed were no ordinary animals, they were zombies locked up in a laboratory! Elena was shocked, but there were no other options. All she could do was to overcome her fear and the grotesque zombies to continue with her work.\nThe hellish life continued for an unknown period of time before Elena woke up from a nightmare one day to find a paper note next to her. The note included a detailed escape route and the guard shift rotation schedules, there was also a key next to the note.

After growing up, Bonnie received a job offer from Eden Corp. with her outstanding scores and became an employee of the largest corporation in the living society. Bonnie had it all, everything was nothing but smooth sails in the first few years, but she slowly began to notice that there was more to the corporation than what's on the surface. The deeper she became involved with Eden Corp., the more she suspected them of hiding some kind of large secret. Just as her suspicions continued, Coleman, a member of the Minuteman, the largest military force in the society of the living, and the rescue team captain that led the team who escorted Bonnie and Helen to the society of the living had found her to ask her to assist in investigating Eden Corp. Due to the relationship the two continued after the rescue, Coleman kept no secrets and told Bonnie that the Volunteer Army suspects that Eden Corp. has something to do with the zombie catastrophe and that they're continuing some kind of extremely classified operation in secret.

I'd had enough of this bullshit. \n"Are sure you about this, Fernando? You won't survive outside the community." The reviewer asked me with a disdainful look on his face. Before the fire, Bonnie's words still lingered in my head, "Don't ever underestimate yourself, Fernando. You are so much more than you think you are." \nI spat at the doorman and shouted contemptuously, "Keep dragging your ass for this pathetic community! I'll find someplace better. I'm a genius, after all!"</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251013=Chased down by a stout man, Natalie clutched tightly the two slices of black bread she had stolen, panting heavily. \n"You little brat, stealing my stuff! I'll teach you a lesson!" \nNatalie checked her cry as the man rained down his fists on her little body, stuffing into her mouth the tasteless food she just stole, the only thing she had eaten over the last week. To her, the pain inflicted on her body was nothing compared to her dying stomach. That's how Natalie survived the last seven years. Without the strength and skills of an adult, she could only resort to stealing food while enduring all the curses and beatings. \n"Stop it, Bacchus!" An unfamiliar voice broke out, interrupting the abusive routine for the first time. \n"Prof... Professor Gallo." Noticing it was from the community's prominent Professor Gallo, Bacchus immediately put on his other face and explained, "I'm the victim here. This is the third time this month! It's not like I'm running a charity! Surely you understand how hard to make a living these days, Professor Gallo." \nIt was barely convincing for the mining magnate, who constantly deprived workers of food and delayed their payments, to complain about hardship at the time. Everyone in the community knows Bacchus has the Vindicators backing him for his wrongdoing. Professor Gallo kept quiet and signed to his wife to pick Natalie up. \n"Little girl, what is your name? Where are your parents?" asked Mrs. Gallo while wiping the dust from Natalie's face with a handkerchief. That's when Bacchus realized the little brat he called was actually a girl. \n"......" \n"Madame, this child must be mute. I never heard her utter a word." \nPreoccupied with her hard-won food, Natalie engulfed the bread as they talked. When she regained her strength to clear the blurry images in her eyes, she realized Mrs. Gallo was still there, squatting next to her, tenderly smiling at her. Feeling encouraged, Natalie stuttered out the name she had never been called, the one she had learned from the main character in a tattered book. \n"Natalie... has no parents." \n"Well, would you let us be your parents, then?" Catching the faltering look on Natalie's face, Mrs. Gallo softened her voice, "We can't have children of our own, and I've always wanted to adopt a strong girl like you. Natalie, are you willing to be our daughter? We'll try our best to give you a lovely home." \nNatalie was dumbfounded, as if she was digesting the meaning of the words she had just heard, when Bacchus got impatient and gave her a push, "Are you seriously considering this?! Professor Gallo will be the one developing a vaccine. Do you know how many people are begging to stay by his side? Being adopted by them is a shortcut to happily ever after!" \nA seven-year-old Natalie had no idea what happily ever after meant, much less a vaccine. However, the word "home" appealed to her. Would a home be like that she read in a storybook, warm and with plenty of food and loving parents? Thinking about that, Natalie cast a hopeful glance and nodded vigorously, \n"Yes, I am!"</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251014=[Profile]\nFaction: Solari\nProfession: Geologist\nSex: Female\nAge: Unlocked after rescue\nHeight: Unlocked after rescue\nWeight: Unlocked after rescue\nNationality: Unlocked after rescue\nBlood Type: Unlocked after rescue\nBirthday: Unlocked after rescue\n[Experience]\nUnlocked after rescue</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251015=[Profile]\nFaction: Solari\nProfession: Courier\nSex: Male\nAge: Unlocked after rescue\nHeight: Unlocked after rescue\nWeight: Unlocked after rescue\nNationality: Unlocked after rescue\nBlood Type: Unlocked after rescue\nBirthday: Unlocked after rescue\n[Experience]\nUnlocked after rescue</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251016=[Profile]\nFaction: Solari\nProfession: Farmer\nSex: Male\nAge: Unlocked after rescue\nHeight: Unlocked after rescue\nWeight: Unlocked after rescue\nNationality: Unlocked after rescue\nBlood Type: Unlocked after rescue\nBirthday: Unlocked after rescue\n[Experience]\nUnlocked after rescue</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251017=[Profile]\nFaction: Solari\nProfession: Botanist\nSex: Female\nAge: Unlocked after rescue\nHeight: Unlocked after rescue\nWeight: Unlocked after rescue\nNationality: Unlocked after rescue\nBlood Type: Unlocked after rescue\nBirthday: Unlocked after rescue\n[Experience]\nUnlocked after rescue</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251018=[Profile]\nFaction: Solari\nProfession: Plumber\nSex: Male\nAge: Unlocked after rescue\nHeight: Unlocked after rescue\nWeight: Unlocked after rescue\nNationality: Unlocked after rescue\nBlood Type: Unlocked after rescue\nBirthday: Unlocked after rescue\n[Experience]\nUnlocked after rescue</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251019=[Profile]\nFaction: Solari\nProfession: Breeder\nSex: Female\nAge: Unlocked after rescue\nHeight: Unlocked after rescue\nWeight: Unlocked after rescue\nNationality: Unlocked after rescue\nBlood Type: Unlocked after rescue\nBirthday: Unlocked after rescue\n[Experience]\nUnlocked after rescue</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251020=[Profile]\nFaction: Solari\nProfession: Biologist\nSex: Female\nAge: Unlocked after rescue\nHeight: Unlocked after rescue\nWeight: Unlocked after rescue\nNationality: Unlocked after rescue\nBlood Type: Unlocked after rescue\nBirthday: Unlocked after rescue\n[Experience]\nUnlocked after rescue</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251021=[Profile]\nFaction: Solari\nProfession: Butler\nSex: Female\nAge: Unlocked after rescue\nHeight: Unlocked after rescue\nWeight: Unlocked after rescue\nNationality: Unlocked after rescue\nBlood Type: Unlocked after rescue\nBirthday: Unlocked after rescue\n[Experience]\nUnlocked after rescue</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251022=Genial and responsible in heart, sheriff Brady is the most reliable person in the Everest community. Whether to lead against zombies or to lend a hand to the weak and elderly, he never turns down his urge to be patient and helpful.\nTo him, being the sheriff comes with heavy responsibility. The badge on his chest is more than just a symbol. It represents the trust of the people whose lives he swears to protect. Yet as devoted as he is, it was his family he failed to keep the promise to.\nAfter Brady's parents sacrificed themselves for him and his sister to have a future, he gave up his music dream and drove himself into becoming a sheriff, who mastered killing methods to keep his unhearing sister from harm.\nHowever, god never took pity on the miserable. One day, unprecedented swarms of zombies broke through the community's defense, rendering the safe haven a waking nightmare.\n"Faster, faster!"\nBrady's usual self-possession was ridden with panic. Having backtracked anxiously through the fleeing crowd, he kicked open a door and fired three shots at the zombie pouncing on his sister, only to freeze when he saw the purplish-black wounds on her.\n"Damn it! Damn it! ...No! Please don't do this to me, Jane! I can't!"\nAs her sister signed, begging Brady to kill her, Brady cursed himself with the foulest words he could think of. He couldn't do it when that was his sister he had sworn to protect.\n[Brad... I—don't want to—to end up like—mom and dad...]\nBrady's sister signed with stiff fingers, reminding him of the hellish nightmare that took their parents from them. Dying as the monster she hated was the last thing he wanted for his sister, so he numbed his grieving heart and pulled the trigger, ending the life of his last family member.\nAfter the zombie rush spent itself, mangled bodies and desperate cries filled the ruined street. Brady picked up his sister's body and disappeared into the crowd. The badge he held dear, crushed by the stampeding crowd, was left behind.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251023=Young Emma's memory of her mother comes mainly from the news broadcast at night. As a front-line reporter, her mother was always there facing the camera in a professional suit with sharp eyes and a coherent voice reporting the latest situation on the front line.\nThe photographs taken during those interviews were the window for young Emma to learn about the world. From the mysterious primitive forest to the war-torn battlefield, from the backwater village to the bustling city, Emma pieced the world together from her mother's photos, inspiring her to become a journalist.\nAfter graduation, Emma became an excellent journalist, just as she always wanted. Her photographs and reports induced sympathy with facts, exposing society by focusing on ordinary people's lives outshined by the fast-growing world.\nSadly, the sudden zombie outbreak ended Emma's rising career. After rejecting Zeus Group's intention to propagandize their vaccine, Emma got canceled as a journalist. She had no choice but to return to her father's shelter and earn a living working in the community canteen. However, the worst was yet to come.\nHer father became sensitive and overly paranoid since her mother went missing during a zombie attack. His idea of a safe zone took a drastic turn from the community to only the house they lived in. One day, he even locked Emma in her confined room in fear of losing her.\nEmma, a young girl with a wanderlust spirit, could not accept such a life. She would rather struggle to survive in the ruined world than live nonchalantly under the twisted protection of her father. The tension between father and daughter was building up high until the last straw eventually broke the camel's back.\n"If you leave this place, no one will protect you. Zombies will feast on your head. Bandits will take what's left of you. You'll live a miserable life! And for what? Freedom?!"\nEvery time Emma tried to go out, her father would describe the horrors of surviving alone in the doomsday. Emma knew very well the risk, yet it was still not a good enough reason for her to come to terms with being imprisoned for the rest of her life, so that time, she gave her father a picture of her mother smiling happily on the job.\n"When mother was on the most dangerous front line doing her job, did you consider she reckless and stupid?"\n"I don't think so. You were always proud of her, saying she was doing honest and righteous work."\n"...I wish I had done things differently." As if suddenly deflated, Emma's father bent his sturdy back while his eyes turned red from anger or maybe sadness. After a long while, he uttered a muffled voice.\n"Had she not pursued this dangerous job, our family would have lived happily in the community. And now, she's gone missing, and everyone knows what that means. I won't let you follow in your mother's footsteps!"\n"The world deserves to know the truth! If anyone can finish what mother started, it's me!" Unlike her father, who accepted the death of his wife, Emma believed that her mother was still alive and waiting for her. She assured her father.\n"Father, I'll return with news of mother. I promise you."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251024=Hero Biography</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251025=[Profile]\nFaction: Solari\nProfession: Miner\nSex: M\nAge: 32\nHeight: 180cm\nWeight: 72kg\nNationality: American\nBlood Type: B\nDate of birth: February 17\n[Experience]\nGrowing up in the countryside, Lemuros spoke his local dialect with a weird accent.

Learning about the jobs with good pay in the castle community, he came here to seek a job opportunity, hoping to make some money and settle down here with his parents. Unfortunately, the first boss he met was Bacchus, who was extremely stingy. Bacchus sent him to work in mines, telling him this was a good job everyone wanted with all the living expenses covered. The fact was Lemuros received the lowest pay after completing the largest amount of work. One day, Lemuros was dispatched to help geologist Diana with her mineral investigation. He had a crush on Diana the first time he saw the gentle and lovely lady. He thus decided to buy her a decent gift and express his feelings for her.

He was weak and timid. He had to work around the clock to make ends meet. Despite the tough life, he still had a strong passion for life. Although he could only earn half a loaf of bread with half a day's work, he would still share it with those homeless children he ran into on a stormy midnight. \nIn the chaotic apocalyptic age, compassion did not worth a penny. Timid Matthew soon became the one bullied by others. He was often punched and kicked, and even robbed by those bullies. The pain all over his body made Matthew realize that no other people would help the ones suffering from poverty and hunger as he did. \n"Fight or get bullied." \nThe next time the punks tried to cut his hair in a gutter, Matthew clenched his fists. \n"The more I appear to be afraid of them, the more troubles they'll provoke." \nHe gritted his teeth when the money he earned with a day's work was taken away by the punks brandishing wolfsbane. \n"Good men were bullied yet the villains were not punished." \nThe day his supplies were taken away by a child he once helped on that stormy night, Matthew finally gave up all his innocent hopes. \nHe then decided to join the Vindicators. He changed into a fancy haircut and painted a terrifying mask on his face with colored paint. He even began to bully the weak. When he hit an enemy with his crowbar, saw his splashing blood, and heard his screaming, Matthew felt that a part of him was gone. \nYet Matthew was happy to see the loot he got. He ran away while laughing despite the pursuit of the vigilantes behind him. That day, he also ran away from his past when he was somewhat timid but was willing to share food with the children.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251029="Sir! The number of zombies in the northwest of our community exceeded the alarm level! We are all at your order." \nOn receiving the report from the soldier, McKinley was leaning back in his chair with his legs crossed, checking the warrant officer's badge he had just received. In contrast to the anxiety of the soldier, he shook off the cigarette ash and then rose to his feet slowly: \n"I see. Just a couple of zombies, right? No need to worry." \n"But the radar indicated that the zombies are closing in faster than usual. Do we need to ask for some reinforcement, Sir?" The soldier suggested hesitantly. \nWith his multiple victories and recent promotion in rank, McKinley was quite confident about his judgment. He interrupted the soldier's report and gave his order:\n"The zombies must be attracted by someone who went out to search for resources without permission! I received such reports every single month! Stop worrying over such trivial things. Be a real soldier, okay? I'll get rid of a bunch of those brainless things with one shot! Now tell our men to gather in ten minutes. We'll finish off this zombie horde." \n"Yes, Sir!" \nThe troops soon assembled in front of the gate of the community in a well-organized way. McKinley boasted his merits and victories again in front of the residents, and promised that he would bring all the soldiers back after this victory. As the soldiers arrived at the site, however, they were all stunned by the colossal being they saw. There was a Mutated Zombie which was several meters tall and had blackish and purplish skin. They started to shoot at the zombie, yet the bullets did not slow down its movement, but made it turn violent. It roared while dashing towards the soldiers. The neat defensive formation was instantly destroyed. \nMcKinley who had disdained to take the advice of the soldier now knew he made a fatal mistake. And the price was the death of the fellow soldiers who fought alongside him for years. He shouted at the troops, ordering everyone to retreat. But sadly, he could not change a thing. \n"Sir, run!" \nThe last soldier used his body to shield McKinley from a zombie and push him into the vehicle. He dared not look at the corpses for one more second. And so the young warrant officer became a shameful deserter he once hated the most.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251030=Due to Brom's perilous career as a mercenary, his wife had to lead an unsettled life with him for years. With the birth of their daughter, however, Brom finally decided to "retire." The only thing he couldn't let go of was the group of lads he trained in his mercenary team. Meanwhile, these energetic young men were eager to show Brom what they could do to impress him.\n"Boss, let us do this escort mission alone this time! Your wife just gave birth; you do need to stay here to take care of her," said one of the young mercenaries, while stroking the pinky face of the baby in Brom's arm. Judging from his resolute tone, the young man was quite confident about their ability.\n"By the way, the little princess is almost three months old! Haven't you decided her name yet, boss? We can't keep calling her 'baby girl' all the time, right?"\n"None of your business, okay? Her name was already decided," Brom replied. Worried that the baby would be aroused by the young man, Brom pushed him aside and placed the sleeping baby back in the crib in a clumsy yet gentle manner. Then, he grabbed the young man by the ear and dragged him out of the room before raising his voice, \n"Do the escort mission alone? You think it's an easy thing, don't ya? Let me tell you, the stuff is going to Vindicators' base. The least predictable lunatics in the wasteland! If you guys can really complete the mission without my help, maybe I'll consider handing the mercenary team to you."\nUpon hearing Brom's words, the young man, who was joking around moments ago, suddenly put on a serious look. He saluted Brom in a not-so-standard gesture and answered firmly, \n"Copy that. We'll make sure the mission is completed well!"\nIn fact, these carefree young men grew faster than Brom had expected. On the day of the mission, they easily infiltrated the Vindicators' base in disguise and handed the stuff to their contact. The mission was accomplished perfectly, after which Brom and the young men came back together. Looking at the lads chatting happily and mocking each other for the flaws in their disguise, Brom had a rare smile of relief on his face. He was now assured that it was time to start his leisure life with his wife and daughter, and these young men...would definitely create a better future for fellow mercenaries.\nWhat Brom did not expect, however, was the horrible scene he saw when they got closer to their base. Rows of houses fell down, with many objects burnt. Brom suddenly realized the seemingly simple escort mission was a trap to lure them away. He immediately rushed into the house, only to find his wife lying in a pool of blood, clinging tightly to the key to the secret room. To prevent the enemies from knowing the existence of the secret room, she left her daughter in the secret room alone and went out to distract the enemies.\n"Our dau-daughter...is in the...secret room... Go! Find her...and...leave the place..." With her last ounce of strength, his wife handed him the key, "Promise me...keep Doris safe..."\nDoris, the name that they decided to unveil after they settled in their new home, now became her last words.\nBrom could barely contain his rage right now. In his eyes was the determination to slay the enemy. To protect his little girl from being retaliated, Brom quickly came up with a plan - the Minutemen. The next day, he left her daughter on the road that the Minutemen would pass by every day. He then hid himself in a bush and waited until he saw Captain Bolton who was shocked to see the baby pick her up. He knew the Minutemen would be a better protector for Doris. He then swore to seek the enemies that killed his wife and complete the revenge with the rest of his life.\n"I'm not a good husband; nor am I a good father. But I swear I'll make sure Doris grows up safe and sound."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251031="Get lost, you stinking thing!" the owner shoved Barron out of the restaurant. Pointing at the rice crumbs on Barron's lips, the owner shouted at him, "Can't you stop eating for five minutes? You haven't done a thing I told you to do. Do you think I'm kind enough to offer free lunches to lazy bones? Be gone, idiot!"\n"Sorry... but I did my work..." Faced with the owner's insults, Barron did not show a slight trace of anger. Rubbing his round belly, he replied hesitantly in a low voice, "I was just hungry... I promise I'll start working right after filling up my stomach!"\n"Hungry? You ate an entire barrel of food! That's the ration of three days for a normal man! You've said "hungry" dozens of times today. I don't want to hear the word anymore, you freak!" The owner tossed the empty food container in front of Barron furiously. Initially, he thought Barron was but a dumb guy with great force. He never expected how big a stomach Barron got. He threw Barron's luggage out and slammed the door.\n"But...Ouch!" Barron, who wasn't quite articulate, failed to convince the owner and was hit by the door in the face. Once again, he was "dumped" by another boss. He roamed on the street and somehow walked into a filthy alley. He almost stumbled upon a box as he could barely "watch" his footsteps because of his round belly. Not long after, his stomach began to rumble loudly.\n"My stomach... Barron is hungry..." \nWhile muttering to himself, Barron's noticed the leftover food in a dumpster ahead. It was a mix of food scraps that had been there for who knows how many days. The awful rotten smell could not even turn on the appetite of rats. But Barron didn't care about it. The painful memory of hunger and nausea made eating an instinctive reflex for him. As long as it could alleviate his hunger, Barron would eat anything. And so, he approached the dumpster and stuffed everything he could grab into his mouth, without trying to tell what exactly he was eating.\n"Oh, my goodness! What is he eating?" A passerby exclaimed in fear. Barron paused for a second and turned his head toward the man, with a mouthful of flesh in his mouth. The next second, the man screamed, "That...that's a human arm, geez!! The freak is eating human flesh! Help! Help!! I saw a cannibal!"\n"No, Barron is just having a meal," Barron tried to explain, but the remains on his lips explained everything. In a community where the humane side did not perish yet, eating the flesh of one's own kind was no doubt a red flag. Driven away by the guards, Barron had to leave the community.\n"Why did they ask Barron to leave? Barron didn't do anything wrong. Barron was just hungry." Unable to tell the difference between human and animal flesh, Barron couldn't understand why they treated him that way.\nDue to unbearable hunger, he kept walking in the hope of finding another dumpster. Soon, the bodies surrounded by a few zombies drew his attention. On seeing his "food", Barron knocked down the zombies with his bare fists in a minute. Just as he was about to enjoy his "feast," a mysterious man came to him and passed him a loaf of bread that Barron hadn't seen in years.\n"Are you saying I can get food as long as I do as you say and kill someone?" Barron thought about the "deal" for a couple of seconds and nodded, "Sure, as long as I get food to eat, I'll help you take revenge."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251032=One day, Kin Ogawa, who was looking for ores to enhance his sword, arrived at a refugee shelter. The refugees, dressed in rags, huddled in small groups next to damaged walls. They were also holding their breath, because several zombies were pacing around not far away. \nBy the time Kin arrived, these survivors had run out of food and were on the verge of starvation. Despite the tough situation, none of them dared to break out and seek help. The group of zombies in the distance were of a smaller size in number. Still, they chose to stay in the ruins rather than fight for a way out. Cowardice was their biggest enemy. As most of them were about to starve to death, Kin, who came here to look for ores, gave them a gleam of hope. \n"Look! Someone's here! He's one of the Wildlings. Save us, sir!" The group of people who were lying in the corner "miraculously" gained strength and crawled to Kin. They dragged Kin's trousers, begging him to take them away. \n"The nearest human community is right there in the east. Only three kilometers away." Kin stepped back and shook off the "welcoming" hands. He then put back his tilted hat and raised one hand, showing them the direction of the community. \n"We know where the community is. But you see there are so many zombies ahead. As a member of the Wildlings, it's reasonable for you to escort us there, isn't it?" Said one refugee, with many more nodding at him to show approval. \n"Exactly. The Wildlings shouldn't be so ruthless." \n"It's your duty to help the weak like us!" \n</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  "......" Kin was caught speechless by the rude "request." He looked at this group of people who waited for others to "help" them, who reminded him of the zombies who lost their dignity with nothing left but a human-like appearance. \nWith a clinging sound, he pulled out his sword to warn the refugees. Finally, they stopped dragging him.\n"Sorry. I'm afraid I can't help you." Kin said as he threw a short knife on the ground: "Grab the weapon and protect yourself, guys. With arms and legs, you are not in need of any help from Wildlings." \n"I'm heading to the human community right now and will get rid of the zombies on the way. Those who want to leave, take the weapon and follow me; those who want to live with the fear of the so-called "danger", stay here and wait for the miracle to happen." \nAfter finishing his words, Kin turned around and left. The refugees began to protest behind him in a loud voice, "accusing" Kin of his ruthless attitude. When they realized that Kin was not waiting for them, they panicked. \n"Heh, gentleman. Please, please wait... Uhh... Be gone, disgusting zombies!" They then stood up and picked up the knife, running towards Kin as fast as they could. It turned out that fighting a zombie head-on was much more terrifying than running away from them. But when a man finally held the knife and aimed at the zombies, something inside him seemed to have changed out of a sudden. \n"Wait. I want to thank you for your words." The man who slayed a zombie on his own for the first time ran to Kin. \n"What do you mean? I didn't do anything." \n"No, you made me realize that it's always better to save myself than wait for someone else to save me."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251033=Harman was born in the Tribe of Sand, one of the most powerful tribes in the wasteland. People there were all remarkable weapon makers who could craft weapons that could be used to either fight off invaders or protect their fellow residents. The chief of the Tribe of Sand was in an old age. That's why on the day of the annual celebration, he announced the rules for the election of the next chief. The candidates needed to hunt down the mutated zombies outside the tribe and Harman was one of the candidates. \nDue to his dull and overly righteous personality, he did not have the support of many people. Harman did not care much about what others thought as a matter of fact. He went out alone for the zombie hunt. By the time he saw a mutated zombie following the trail left by it, someone was already fighting it alone. In the face of a zombie twice as tall as a human, even a strong warrior would be dwarfed. The weapon in his hand appeared to be a children's toy, which could barely leave a scratch on the thick skin of the zombie. \nAt this moment, the zombie was trying to throw the warrior into the air with its long arm; its sharp claws were about to tear the warrior's chest apart. Harman wasted no time and threw his weapon at the zombie to stop it. \n"Thank goodness... I'm still alive!" exclaimed the warrior. "Thank you so much, uhh...Mr...?" \n"Call me Harman." \n"Oh, Harman! I don't know how to thank you! If it weren't for you, I would have died ten seconds ago." The warrior was obviously embarrassed by the fact that he didn't even know the name of his savior. He then tried to start another topic: "I never expected someone would stand out and save me in the middle of such a vital competition. The candidates were all fighting for themselves and wished that more competitors could be "eliminated" here." \nOn hearing the statement, Harman showed a shocked face. He could not understand why a warrior would refuse to save his fellow warriors from the same tribe. He answered in a sincere tone: "Lives always come before the competition." \nThis was also what the chief often said. It was the first time someone mentioned it in a decisive competition. The young warrior was dumbfounded. He forced out a smile and proposed tentatively: "Well...then why don't we work together to get rid of the big fella first?" \n"Sure." \nHarman held up his weapon and headed toward the giant zombie. Under Harman's cover, the young warrior was able to get closer to the zombie and launched a few deadly cannonballs. Together, they managed to blow the head off the zombie. \n"Good job, dude! You know what? This is the first time I got a partner in the zombie hunt! And...it feels great!! But who should get the credit for this zombie?" \n"Half for you 'n half for me, I guess. Alright, time to look for the next prey." \n"Okay, fair enough. Let's see who could hunt more zombies in the end." The two competitors headed in opposite directions after a quick fist bump.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251034=Born into a family of soldiers, Bolton was a scrupulous and upright man. He had been fighting on the front line for years, turning from a rookie into a general. He gained outstanding merit in battles. In the wake of the zombie crisis, however, Bolton's once-promising career path met the Waterloo. The numb zombies that did not know what pain was kept spreading a contagious virus. Cities fell one after another. Bolton's army had to retreat all the way to a suburban town, where they tried their best to safeguard the remaining survivors.\nDays later, they managed to drive away the zombie horde. As everyone was celebrating the hard-won victory, Bolton received an urgent report from the front line, saying that an even larger zombie horde, composed of over a thousand zombies, was heading towards the town. They were estimated to arrive by the night of the next day. In the previous battle, Bolton's army had suffered heavy casualties fighting against hundreds of zombies. Now they had to face an enemy ten times the size of the previous one. This was undoubtedly devastating for a small town with about a hundred guards only. Even Bolton, who had fought and won many battles could not come up with a feasible tactic. At the critical moment, He received a letter from his father. The former commander-in-chief presented him with another option. \n"Bolton, the zombie horde will arrive at the city of X tonight. Leave the place now with the escorting army." \n"Leave? Are you asking me to be a deserter?!" Out there were the people whose lives were in danger. If a soldier like him chose to run away, how could others have faith to live on? He would rather die among the zombies than act as a deserter. \nHe tore up the letter in rage and turned around to go back to his command room. Two soldiers who were supposed to escort Bolton in the retreat stood before him. \n"What do you think you are doin'? Disobey my order? Get out of my way!" \n"Sorry, sir. We cannot disobey the commander-in-chief either. Please come with us." \n"Fine. You either let me stay here, or kill me now."\n"Sir, please come with us. You've already done too much. You've been staying here protecting those useless survivors for three months. In such an apocalypse, the old social order has long gone. No one will blame you for leaving at such a time."\nAnother soldier nodded, "Yes, many armies were disbanded these days. It's hard to stay alive, let alone take care of others."\nMore soldiers who had already decided to retreat began to persuade Bolton to leave. If they left now, at least they could stay alive. They stood little chance of beating the zombie horde even if they stayed there any longer.\n"If we disband like others do, there will be not a single army left." Regardless of the persuasion, Bolton made up his mind and came up with an idea, a bold but resolute one: "If the old order perished in the apocalyptic age, I'll create a new one then. We need at least one organization where people can protect each other with one mind!" \n"Yes! I'll create an organization with the power of solidarity!" said young Bolton in a resolute voice. Little did he know that it was this idea that led to the creation of a powerful organization that completely changed the political landscape of the apocalyptic world.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251035="Enrique, what are you doing? Lucky is dead! Just let me bury her." \nNatalie ran over to stop Enrique, who was holding a knife and trying to do something to the poor puppy named Lucky. Enrique did not stop what he was doing at all. He continued to point the knife at different parts of the dog's abdomen as if looking for a proper spot for dissection. A few seconds later, he replied slowly and nonchalantly: \n"As you said, it's a dead dog, so I can do anything I want to it. Don't you want to know what it's like inside a dog that hasn't turned into a zombie dog? Think about this. If I can learn something useful from the dissection, the dog is making a contribution to scientific research in a way." \n"Stop it. You're not Dr. Gallo. You don't know a thing about biology!" \n"Right. That's why I need to practice." \n"Lucky died when she tried to protect my father's lab from zombies. You can't treat her like what you did to those useless rubbish." \n"But it's dead already, isn't it? Once it's dead, it's useless." \nEnrique, who was only in his teens, showed his cold and ruthless nature that was more terrifying than what you could see from an adult. In his eyes, things were either "useful" or "useless." Emotions were not worth a thing to him. Looking at Enrique's emotionless eyes for a few seconds, little Natalie gave up. She ran away to ask for help from his father, Dr. Gallo. Just as Enrique was about to continue his dissection, someone came over while giving him a round of applause. The stranger was in a cape with skull-shaped patterns on it. \n"Impressive! Well said, young man!" The man continued in his lunatic tone, "I've been looking for someone like you, someone who could think bold and act bold at such a young age! You are born to be one of the Vindicators!" \n"Vindicators...what do you mean?" \n"An organization made of only the strong. We do not convince a person with words, but fists." \n"An organization of the strong? Sounds interesting, this Vindicators group." \n"Looking forward to seeing you at our next meeting then." \nThe man handed young Enrique an invitation letter and went away. He knew he didn't need to say anything else. The child who could say something like "Once it's dead, it's useless" would definitely join the Vindicators one day, sooner or later.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251036=Blanche was a bad student who had just dropped out of school. She also had another important identity, the lead singer of an underground band. Her powerful voice and impressive guitar play soon won her great fame. The band was also known by more people because of its passionate and addictive songs. The day the band held its first underground heavy metal concert, the apocalypse broke out unexpectedly. \n"Deathcore! Deathcore! Deathcore!" \nThe fans shouted out the name frantically to welcome the band onto the stage. After a short high-pitched sound, the spotlight shone upon the center of the stage, and Blanche stepped onto the stage, with a guitar in her hand. The audience burst into louder cheers. The crowd called Blanche's nickname over and over again.\n"Metalhead! Metalhead!" \n"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the deathcore party!! Tonight, we'll revive from death. Tonight, we'll bring you a new song that keeps your heart pounding! Now listen — the Roar of Death!" \nA good song was always the best way to show appreciation to the support from the fans. Blanche and her teammates nodded at each other. With the drummer dropped the first beat, a sensational melody started. People began to dance to the beat. As the song reached its climax, the cheers grew louder. No one noticed that, at this moment, someone opened his crimson eyes among the crowd, with his limbs twisted in a creepy way. He seemed to be saying something, but his voice was low and hoarse. \n"Heh, stay away from me! It's a place to listen to music, okay? Heh! What the heck! What are you doin'?" \nAs a lady raised her voice to warn the "stranger" standing way too close to her, another person turned around to see what happened. As he was trying to pat on the shoulder of the guy who "disturbed" others, he somehow paused midway, with his arm freezing in the air. The next second, he was bitten on his neck by the "weird" guy. The zombie virus began to spread rapidly against the deafening music. It was not until a zombie crawled onto the stage and tried to bite the drummer that Blanche realized what actually happened. The performance immediately paused; more audience noticed the "weirdly behaving" guys around them. In contrast to the deafening music just now, the entire hall was filled with screams and cries. \nThe guitar, which had gone through a special modification before the performance, now became an excellent weapon that came in handy. In order to help the audience get out of the hall, Blanche brandished her beloved guitar to clear a way for them. The metal guitar hit the heads of one zombie and another, making strange yet unique sounds. It sounded like the whisper of the Reaper, an overture to a new chapter of death.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251037="Dad...how you doin' today?" \nLying on the bed with a pale face, Alice said in a light-hearted tone and forced out a smile at Roland who dropped by the hospital to see her, but her clenched fist and the sweat-soaked bed sheet "gave her out." Roland was heartbroken to see the scene. He walked to the bedside, extending his hand to warm the cold hand of Alice, and replied gently: \n"Alice, just a few more days to go. Dad's research will be soon completed. Then we'll replace your heart with a metal one, strong enough to help you grow healthily like everyone else. It's gonna be alright. Everything's gonna be alright...okay?" \nRoland, a shrewd and successful businessman, now was just a father somewhat panicked at his daughter's aggravating illness. He kept comforting her with repeated words, as if the more times he repeated, the more likely it would come true. A day ago, the doctor told them about the new treatment plan — a heart transplant, as Roland mentioned. Alice failed to hide the fear on her face this time, no matter how hard she tried. She was a seven-year-old child after all. The unsuccessful treatments previously were a torment to both her body and mind. She had enough of the agony all over her body. Compared to the tiny hope of recovery, the young girl was more afraid of the unknown pain. \n"Prosthetic surgery...will it hurt?" \n"No, Dad will never let any pain torture you again. I promise." \nRoland promised her in a soft yet resolute voice. He had been proceeding with the prosthetic experiment personally over the past years. He even volunteered to be the first one to receive the prosthetic transplant surgery to test its safety. He replaced his right arm, with which he first held his beloved daughter, with a prosthetic arm, hoping that the metallic arm could be strong enough to protect her daughter from any harm. But he never expected that, by the time he woke up in the ward, the doctor told him that his daughter failed to make it this morning and passed away. \n"NOOOO! That's not true! Alice is just sleeping...there...there must be a way to cure her...virus? zombie? Ahh!" \nRoland carefully placed his daughter in the sleep pod. Looking at Alice who he believed was "having a sound sleep", Roland was now taken over by madness: "Hold on, sweetheart! Dad will find a way to wake you up!"</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251038=Beesly was the most notorious name in the town. Who was he? A delinquent who did nothing else but pick up troubles, roam around, and sneak things from his neighbors as a way to collect the so-called "protection fee." He was the one that everyone hated in the town. The day the zombie crisis broke out, however, he somehow turned into another man.\n"Mommy, where are you? Daddy...Daddy is so scary right now! Help, Mom…"\n"Lily! Don't be afraid. Mommy's here. Now get out through that window! I'll help you stop Daddy."\nHer father, who turned into a zombie, now was getting closer to the room where she and her mother were hiding. The little girl dragged the arm of her mother who fell into a coma, trying to wake her up. Hearing her daughter's cry, the mother regained consciousness slowly, but she was not able to stand up given her legs that were hit in the fights against her "husband." The only thing she could do was to crawl all the way to the door and keep the door shut with her body, to earn Lily more time to run away. The saddening fact was, even if Lily made it to get out, how many days a little girl like her could survive alone in the apocalyptic times? The mother dared not think further. As she was overwhelmed by the devastating situation, the zombie outside the door stopped pounding on the door.\n"Now get lost! Out of my way! Who's there? The zombie was thrown out. Now come out. You're safe!”\nThe mother heard the loud and irritable voice of Beesly from behind the door, along with the sound of the zombie falling heavily to the ground. Not receiving any response from inside, Beesly began to knock on the door, more violently than the zombie did before. The appearance of the grumpy man gave the woman and her daughter a gleam of hope at the desperate moment.\n"Mommy! A hero has come to save us! Look, a real hero!"\n"Heh! Little girl. Stop callin' me a hero. I'll consider exempting your protection fee if you behave as a good kid." Beesly said so in a seemingly intimidating tone and laid his hand on the little girl’s shoulder, trying to stop her from getting closer. But the girl was not scared at all by the "hero" in her eyes.\n"Beesly… I never thought... Anyway, thank you so much." The mother wiped the tears from her face and looked at Beesly with gratitude. Beesly, who used to argue a lot with this neighbor, felt a bit guilty and uneasy thinking of what he had done before. He then waved his hand and put on an indifferent look:\n"Enough with the tears. You paid the protection fee, I did my job. Not a big deal." He extended his hand to help the woman stand up. The three then left the saddening place and headed to the fortress in the neighboring town. The scene on the streets was even worse. Countless bodies were on both sides of the road. To distract the little girl, Beesly started a conversation with her:\n"I can see you are very brave and got great force. I'll give you some real training when we get to the fortress. Then you can be as strong as me."\n"You mean I can be a heroine myself and protect my mom from zombies?"\n"Surely you will. It'll just take a few more years' time."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251039="Pamela, how come you only got second place in the competition?"\n"Stop playing with them. Are you done with your training today? Do not leave the shooting range before you hit the target!"\n"Pamela, I'm so upset. I don't get it. How could my kid be so incompetent? Your father and I are both Olympic champions. How can you fail over and over again without making any progress?"\nEvery time Pamela stood in the shooting range, the criticisms from her parents would be repeated in her mind, making her more panicked and terrified every time she made a mistake. The shooting range used to be the place she loved the most. Now it was a hell full of nightmare. She stared at the human-shaped targets in the distance, as if she saw a bunch of monsters mocking how "incompetent" she was. Her trembling hands now made it impossible for her to pull the trigger.\n"If I can't hit the target, the whole thing is meaningless. Maybe what mom and dad are correct. I just don't have the talent for this."\nPamela thought to herself in despair. The idea made her become more silent. One day, she put her beloved pistol in the box, together with her shattered dream.\n"Hey, Pamela, isn't it the day of the youth shooting competition today? Why are you still here? I got a new cheerleading outfit. Good luck for our sharpshooter!" Little Lori knocked on the window pane and peered at the inside from the half-open window.\n"Go watch the competition yourself. Please leave me alone. I won't be able to get the first place anyway. Cheer for someone else then." Pamela said so in a gloomy mood.\n"Pamela! What's goin' on? You know I watch the competition not for the champion, but for my best friend, you!" Lori frowned and knocked on the window pane again.\n"Cheer up, my best friend and the best shooter!"\n"Forget about it. I can't be the champion anyway. That'll waste all your efforts." Pamela tried to shut the window, only to find Lori was no longer there.\n"Who cares about that title!" Lori's loud voice suddenly sounded from outside the door. She dashed into the room and took out the box from under the bed. Ignoring Pamela's refusal, Lori still handed the pistol to her and said: "I don't care who wins. What I want to see is my dear Pamela who can stay calm and poised in the competition and hit the target like nothing can stop her."\n"C'mon. Let's give it another go. I'll go with you."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251040=In the early days of the apocalypse, humans freshly managed to rebuild their community. Every place was haunted by a gloomy and depressing air. A wave of zombie attacks just ended. Humans suffered heavy casualties again. More than half of the adults were killed or injured, leaving some elderly people or people with disabilities using as much force as they had to bandage the wounded and bury the dead. One could see little hope in the eyes of the people. The waves of zombie attacks took away so many lives. No one knew who would be the next. Everyone was living with a countdown over their heads; more and more people gave up on survival and began to wait calmly for the reaper to take them away.\n"Anyone there? I need some help!"\nLori, who had just escaped from a zombie siege, finally arrived at the human community after three days of walking, thanks to the clues left by other survivors. She shouted for help at the gate, but no one responded. The silence even made her believe the entire community had fallen. When she saw the clothes hanging on the other side of the wall and tire trails left recently, she knew there must be people living there. But why no one showed up yet or responded to her? Lori found the place a bit weird.\n"Go somewhere else." When Lori knocked on the gate half a minute later, the lifeless eyes of an old lady appeared from the crack of the gate.\nThe old lady opened the door slowly and told Lori what happened to the community. Behind the gate were all wounded soldiers and abandoned children. They could barely find a dozen soldiers who could still fight on the battlefield among all residents in the community. One zombie could easily kill the last batch of survivors here. Lori was not the first one who visited the community. Many came here before to seek help, but they all left after learning about the terrible situation here. The old lady did not expect that Lori would stay, so she waved at Lori and signaled Lori to leave if she wanted to find another shelter.\n"Leave? Why would I leave? We have so many survivors here! I finally have a place to stay!"\n"Did you listen to what I said? All the survivors here can't even fight off a single zombie. The community won't last long."\n"If we can't beat them, we may hide from them for the moment. There will always be a way to live on. Don't give up this easily, ma'am!" Lori's voice was like a ray of sunshine, lighting up the dull community and bringing people a gleam of hope.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251041="Annie, I'll go collect some food. I'll be back before it's getting dark. Remember, do not open the door for anyone, even if the guy claims to be a survivor like us, okay?" \nFiona, who was doing her final preparations before she went out to gather resources, reminded her younger sister again of the potential threat from strangers. Months ago, Annie agreed to let a child who was asking for help into the house and ended up being attacked by the robber waiting outside. Although Fiona went back in time and prevented any further losses, the scars left on Annie's arm remained a regretful memory for Fiona. \n"Fiona, I'm 16 now. I want to do something to help you support the family." Annie took over Fiona's pistol and made an awkward shooting pose, trying to prove how much she had grown up. \n"Fine. Good for you. You're now a 'big kid' who's as tall as the height of my chest." Fiona replied coldly, snatching back the pistol and holding it high with one hand so that Annie could not reach it. "You're helping me a lot when you stay at home as I say." \n"There you go again! I'm not a kid anymore. I can..." \n"Alright. Alright. So how about this? When you turn 18, I'll teach you how to fight zombies, okay? Now, just stay home and wait for me." \n"Deal!" \nFiona, who went out hunting as usual, did not expect that this random promise would be the last conversation with her younger sister. By the time she returned, she found the iron door, which was ten centimeters thick, had been completely corroded by an unknown poison. The living room was messy. Something bad must have happened. She gripped her gun and walked into Annie's bedroom, only to find a zombie with greenish liquid dripping from its mouth sitting next to her body. The fact was in the apocalypse, humans were not the only ones trying to get used to the changing environment. Zombies were evolving too. They even developed some new "abilities" while eating their own kind. \nFiona, who always thought that she could be there protecting Annie, believed there was no need to make Annie face the harsh reality and the deadly zombies so early. She did not expect that the inability to fight put Annie in danger when a zombie broke in one day. \n"If I had not treated her as a kid and taught her how to fight a zombie, would things be different?"\nEvery night, when Fiona looked at the photo of herself and Annie, she would pose the question to herself over and over again. She would not get any answer though. She could only try to find the answer by giving her trainees strict training and teaching more young people how to fight zombies. \n"My son is only seven years old! You shouldn't be so harsh on him! Look at the wounds on his body. I'm gonna report you! You're abusing him!" In the community, a mother holding a boy with wounds on his body was accusing Fiona of her harsh way of training. \n"Of course, I can teach him later." Fiona said coldly, believing the lady was simply spoiling her child. "Unfortunately, zombies won't wait until a child grows up before killing him."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251042=In the serene and isolated suburb, a magnificent manor stood on a hillside surrounded by lush jungles. Away from the bustling city, the place was one of the few "virgin lands" in the early stages of the zombie apocalypse. Yet the situation did not last long. One day, a servant who went out to get supplies was accidentally scratched by a zombie. The moment his crimson eyes opened marked the falling of this secret paradise. \n"Let us go. It's the day for the expedition on the hill!" \nDressed in haute couture, the young master Galande who held young Theodore in rags by his hand argued with the butler who tried to stop him from going out. He had just promised his new buddy that he would take him on a fun expedition; a minute later, he was stopped at the gate. The young master felt somewhat awkward.\n"Master Galande, it's quite dangerous out there. Zombies are found in our manor. The helicopter will be here very soon. Could you wait for a while and continue your expedition until you arrive at the safe zone?" \nAlthough the butler was warning the young master of the danger outside, he did not show the slightest trace of panic at all. He knew they did not need to worry about safety and survival, given the power and influence of the Galande family. He even asked the chef to make a dessert for the young master to find him something to do while waiting, despite that survivors outside were fighting each other for food. \n"What about others? The gardeners and chefs, will they go with us?" \n"You know, the helicopter does not have that many seats." \nTheodore, who stayed silent for a while, posed a question hesitantly. The butler answered him like this in a polite yet decisive tone. Obviously, those "unimportant servants" were not included in the relocation plan in the first place. The butler did not frown for a second, as if the servants' lives mattered not to him.\n"B-but...how can they fight off zombies if they stayed here? They would die." \n"Everyone will die. The weak are only more susceptible. Anyway, you and I are still alive, right? No need to worry about those unimportant to us." \nGalande, who grew up with the idea of "survival of the fittest", could not understand why Theodore cared so much about the servants. He believed he was generous enough to invite Theodore to leave the place together. Why the latter did not appreciate his friendly gesture, and even stared at him with an angry look? \n"You mean the lives of the weak could be given up this easily? Have you ever thought of what would happen if one day you were no longer with the 'team of the strong'?" \n"Ha-ha. No way. I am and will always be the strongest." \n"I see." \nTheodore, who had always been by Galande's side, turned around and left. He refused the "kind invite" to go to the safe zone with Galande. Instead, he ran to notify all servants to leave the manor as fast as they could. Witnessing how Theodore ran towards the servants' room where zombies were roaming around without hesitation, Galande began to doubt himself for the first time: \n"Did I say something wrong? Why would he rather go back to that dangerous place than leave with me?" \n"There will always be such people who can't tell what matters most. It's not your fault, Master Galande. Your way of thinking is quite similar to your father, I have to admit. You'll surely grow up into an outstanding decision maker."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251043=The fifth year into the apocalypse, the social order collapsed. The dark side of human nature was unraveled. Fighting, looting, capturing, and oppressing...these became commonplace in major human communities. Amid the turmoil, a team in green uniform committed themselves to restoring social order and stability. They were later widely known as the Minutemen. They were the last gleam of hope in the devastating apocalypse. "Wherever Minutemen go, security and order follow" became the consensus among survivors. \nThe rapid growth of the Minutemen soon aroused the attention of the management of the human community. Afraid of losing its influence and, more importantly, its privileges, the management obstructed the rescue missions of Minutemen. As a result, many missions ended in failure. This made Bolton, an officer of the Minutemen, realize that they needed to "handle" the threats if they really wanted to make the organization stronger. At this time, a soldier volunteered to eradicate the enemies for the organization. \n"Theodore, have you thought this over?" Bolton looked at the young soldier in front of him, trying to remind him what he was doing: \n"The 'lifetaker' we are looking for needs to keep his identity completely concealed. By 'completely concealed', I mean you'll have to discard your identity, face and voice, and every single trace of your existence in the past. To protect other 'lifetakers', they will not be allowed to bury you even if you die in the mission. Are you sure you will accept all these conditions?" \n"Someone has to go. I'm an ideal candidate, right?" Theodore picked up the mask on the table and put it on: "Hmm... It fits me perfectly. Looks like I'm really the right person." \nLooking at Theodore's decisive action, Bolton said nothing more. He handed Theodore the forged identity and more info on the enemies. He then patted Theodore on his shoulder, bidding him farewell with a salute: \n"From the moment you leave the barracks, you will be marked as dead in the Minutemen list. Except for sending you the mission info, we will not contact you in any form. You are all on your own. Theodore...ah, sorry...Roger the Lifetaker, may you successfully clear the way for us and complete your mission." \n"Copy that."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251044="D-doc...doc! Please come with me. Unn has gone mad. He kept attacking people!"\n"Alright. Easy. I'll go with you right now."\nWhen Dean dashed into the tent of Jessie the Witch Doctor, Jessie was making some meds with her pot. The clumsy Dean bumped into the pot, spilling all the meds over the floor. On hearing the urgent situation, Jessie left the pot where it was and wiped her hands on her clothes, after which she picked up a few bottles of meds and left home with Dean in a minute.\n"Get out of the way, guys. The witch doctor is here!"\n"Great, it's the witch doctor! Poor Unn can be saved!"\n"How do you do, Jessie!"\n"Thank you for coming here so fast, doc."\nThe crowd around the mad Unn stepped back when they saw Jessie. Everyone greeted Jessie with great respect. Jessie wasted no time and went directly to the patient, who was tied to a pillar by the warriors. He was yelling something at the crowd, with his eyes turning crimson and greenish and sticky liquid drooling from his mouth. As Jessie got closer to him, he began to pounce forward like a ferocious dog. His was so strenuous that the thick pillar was almost moved a bit from the ground. If it was not for the rope, Jessie would have been bitten by him.\n"Watch out! Unn lost his mind. You'd better not get too close to him, doc."\n"It's okay. Anyone knows what Unn did before he developed this symptom?" Jessie was not scared by Unn's attack. In her eyes, the mad Unn was no different from other patients. She also firmly believed that as long as she figured out the signs before he got sick, found the cause, and gave him the right medicine, she would be able to cure him.\n"He didn't do anything special. We just went out hunting as usual. Oh, I remember! There was a weirdo when we came back. Unn asked him if he needed any help and then got bitten by him! That guy's so weird. By the time he came back, he lost his sanity."\n"A weird man? Any other special traits on him?"\n"Let me think. His eyes were red. Saliva was drooling from his mouth. When he saw us, he ran after us! And then Unn got bitten! The man was as lunatic as...as the way Unn is behaving right now."\n"A disease transmitted by biting? Never heard of it."\nJessie went through all the rare diseases in her mind, but failed to find a similar one. This was the first time Jessie was caught in such a tricky situation. She felt a little uneasy, but still forced herself to calm down and pass on the order in time to the warriors waiting behind her: "Dean, move Unn to the tent. Irma, ask if anyone else got bitten in the tribe. Gather them in the tents, if any. Remember, do not get bitten when transferring the patients."\n"Doc, will my dad be okay?" Unn's youngest daughter held Jessie's leg and asked so with some tears left on her panicked face.\n"Of course, your dad is just sick. When we find the cure, he will go back to health right away." Jessie gently stroked the girl's head and answered. It was a promise both to the little girl and the entire tribe.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251045=Between dilapidated buildings, a group of survivors with dust and mud on their bodies embraced each other with joy. Just now, they fought off a zombie horde together. This victory proved that the shelter now had the ability to defend itself and secure people's daily production and life. A new human community thus took shape. That night, a celebration event was held. On a cement platform, the host introduced Mr. Lunn, the biggest sponsor of the community.\n"Tonight, we are here to celebrate the establishment of the S community. Now I'll give the floor to Mr. Lunn! Thanks to his generous funding, we could purchase enough weapons to resist the zombie horde this time. Now let's welcome Mr. Lunn to the stage!" \n"Thank you, Mr. Lunn!" \n"Mr. Lunn is really a good man. I heard that he had been running a charity before the apocalypse. He was still so generous in such a difficult time." \n"I want to work in his company. I bet the pay must be good." \nAmid the applause from the crowd, chubby Lunn walked onto the stage slowly. He did not speak anything first, but raised his golden metallic left hand and adjusted the position of his golden tie. Then, under the passionate gaze of the audience, he opened his mouth: \n"Since day one of the apocalypse, Zeus Group has been helping people rebuild their communities and create a better homeland. We are also aware that today's success is built on the efforts of everyone. So tonight, on behalf of Zeus Group, I'd like to invite all talents and craftsmen of the S community to join us! Together, we can create a better future for mankind! Here's also good news for people with disabilities. As long as you sign the contract with Zeus Group, we'll help you get an artificial limb surgery." \nWhat Lunn said was really heartening. The artificial limb surgery made people with disabilities see a gleam of hope. Plus, the name of Zeus Group itself was trustworthy. People all moved to the registration desk on one side of the stage. Looking at the young people who signed their names with passion and great expectations, Lunn nodded with a satisfied smile. At this time, Duke, the host, approached Lunn and talked to him in a low voice: \n"Boss, at least five hundred people will sign up this time, with a hundred of them already signing a "slave contract." I believe...the result is good enough for you to exempt the cost of my artificial hands?" \n"Heh, it's not a 'slave contract.' We call it a welfare." Lunn straightened up and continued with a seemingly compassionate air: "Look at the young men. They idled around in the community all day long. Now I give them artificial limbs and the opportunity to work for us. Isn't this a win-win solution? It's fair for us to charge them 'some' money for this, right? We have to keep our business running, after all." \n"Yes. Exactly, Mr. Lunn. It's indeed a welfare." Duke nodded with a flattering smile. Not receiving any response from Lunn on the money he owed, he brought it up again hesitantly: "So the cost of my..." \n"I see. I'll report it to my superior and lower your interest rate. Keep up the good work. You'll be able to pay it off soon." Lunn patted Duke on his shoulder and said so.\n"Thank you, Mr. Lunn! Thank you so much!" \nDuke thanked Lunn many times for his "consideration and generosity", not knowing the bill of tens of thousands of dollars was actually issued by Lunn himself.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251046=Born into a family of doctors, Alisa showed her medical talent from an early age. When other kids of her age were still playing arcade games, young Alisa could name many common medicines and memorize their side effects. Influenced by her parents, Alisa also wanted to be a doctor. As a prodigy, she worked hard and was admitted to a top medical college at the age of 16. \nLater, the outbreak of the zombie virus changed Alisa's life. That day, one could see people wailing and corpses left on the streets everywhere in the city. Hospitals were packed with wounded residents. Even the dorm of Alisa was taken as an accommodation for the wounded. Still, the number of casualties multiplied. Alisa and other medical students were asked to join the medical care team. \nAlisa took the mission and immediately headed to the front line. As she saw the wounds from knives and guns on more and more soldiers, she realized the enemies they were facing were not only zombies but also humans. \n"See? These wounds are obviously left by a knife." Alisa pointed to the long and narrow wound on a patient's stomach and said, "How could a man be injured by a knife while trying to run away from zombies? He was attacked by a human!" \n"Shhh. Stop it." Park Ji-mi, a classmate of Alisa, covered Alisa's mouth with her hands. She let out a breath after confirming that no one looked in their direction. "Do you know how chaotic the world out there is? After the old order was gone, many were trying to create a new order and be the new 'king.' The contention among the factions is in full fledge. You don't wanna get involved, do you? Do your job and take care of the patients. That's it." \n"But they are all ordinary people. They were attacked or even killed simply because they somehow got involved in the contention between those factions?" \n"That's true. But what can you do about it? Restore the order on your own? Don't forget it's an apocalyptic age!" Another peer who did not get along quite well with Alisa mocked her. \n"But..." Alisa was caught speechless. But from that day on, the determination to "restore order" began to take shape in her mind. \n"There must be a way. What should I do?" Every night, Alisa, who tossed and turned on the bed, would think like this: \n"Treating the wounded day by day won't stop more deaths caused by the war. I need to do more. But what exactly can I do? How I wish to find a large group of people who wish to restore the order and work together with them."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251047=Headline of World Daily\n"On X/X, the highly anticipated underground railway project finally came to an end. This is the first underground railway in human history. Mr. Pearson, the manager of the project, named the system "subway." Citizens' attitudes toward the new invention were divided. Our special correspondent, Emma, went to the construction site to bring you the latest updates."\n"The first underground railway will start running next Monday. What do you think about it?"\n"Underground? Railway? Eww... That sounds dirty and terrible. I don't need this underground thing." replied Cara, a stubborn and old-fashioned granny in the neighborhood. She continued with a disdainful tone: "With the time and money spent on it, we could have at least two more convenient public transit routes. What's the point of going underground anyway?"\n"That's the first subway ever! Many people want to be among the first batch of passengers! I'll queue up early in the morning tomorrow!" said young courier Jack who appeared to be very interested in the new type of railway. He even took a day off especially to engage in the inauguration tomorrow.\n"Are you talking about that new thing called...uhh...subway! I've heard quite a lot about it." On seeing the reporter, Kate immediately came up to show off the "insider info" she collected: "That subway is designed by Pearson, you know, the guy known for his unbelievable OCD designs! His projects were never delayed or found to be flawed. This subway might bring great changes to the overly crowded city!"\n"Looks like everyone has their own unique insights into the subway. Will it become another milestone in Pearson's career or a flawed design to be polished? We'll see tomorrow!"\nThe next morning, the subway entrance was packed with crowd. In the face of the questions posed by the curious crowd and a bunch of doubts regarding the subway's safety presented by some insignificant news agency, Pearson walked to the makeshift podium next to the locomotive of the subway and delivered his speech.\n"I always believe that transportation is the fundamental factor that drives urban development. Given the crowded and messy urban transportation on the ground, however, I decided to make a breakthrough underground. I know many of you still have doubts about my design. Today, I'll show you how solid the tunnel is, how the smoke is ventilated from the tunnel, and how the safety of passengers can be guaranteed. I'll invite you all to observe with your own eyes, rather than bother you with boring numbers and documents. Of course, I will join you and be the first passenger on this subway. Action speaks louder than words after all."\nAfter finishing his short speech, Pearson boarded the subway. Although many passengers were still waiting on the platform and dared not get into the subway, he did not bother to explain more. By the time the boarding period ended, the red light on the locomotive lit up, with the doors sliding closed and the train starting up slowly and heading away.\n"A new trail has been blazed; the subway will bring us closer than ever!"</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251048=It was a tranquil afternoon in the community. Thirteen-year-old Laura was collecting metal and paper in the waste transfer station with her friends, to sell them and earn some more money for her poor family. Laura saw Harrison heading her way and she knew Harrison was the one managing the farm of the community. \n"He works with people in the farm and cafeteria, he must have some good stuff in store? At least, he could spare some food for me!" Laura thought to herself. Then she ran to the gate with her friends to greet Harrison. \n"Good afternoon, Mr. Harrison! Let me help you drop the garbage." \n"Oh, it's you, Laura. Thank you for your help then. You may drop the lighter bag for me." \nWith a big smile and sweet voice, Laura took a heavy garbage bag from Harrison. The next second, she opened the bag to see what was inside, only to find some rotten and worm-infested leftovers. \n"All leftovers? How come?" Laura was disappointed and complained: "The food supplied by the cafeteria is barely enough. Many people are staving. Why are there so many wasted food? This is WAY too much."\n"Good question. This is a long-standing problem... To save some time when cooking, the chefs would always take the fresh vegetables from the top, leaving those placed at the bottom stacked there for months. In the end, they all ended up rotten and inedible... Never mind. Why would I tell you something like this? You don't understand how things work anyway." \nHarrison was not able to do anything about it. He also hated to waste vegetables, but he couldn't ask people to cook the rotten stuff. Making people sick would be an even worse scenario. That's why he dumped them right away. \n"I understand things, okay? They were wasted because they were not sorted out in time order. I get scolded by my mom when I leave my toys everywhere in the house. That's how I learned to sort out stuff by size and shape to tide up the place real quick."\n"Good to know. Looks like we need to hire a bright girl like you to help us with our management." Harrison patted Laura on her head and went away. But little Laura took his words seriously. \nSince then, Laura stopped her "treasure hunt" routine. Instead, she stayed all day long in the dark and stuffy warehouse, observing what the workers were doing. Her parents thought she was idling away her time, while the workers found she got in the way. No one expected that a young girl could make some really useful suggestions. Laura did not mind what others thought about her. She bound some draft paper she found in the waste transfer station into a notebook, and used a charred branch as a pen to scribble down her insights into goods management. \nTwo months later, when community manager Wolowitz received the notes drafted by little Laura, he immediately realized the suggestions were quite practical.\n"Good rules are good in nature, despite the age of the rule maker." Wolowitz then put Laura's rules into use in his actual management regardless of others' objections. \nThanks to Laura's suggestions, more inlets were added to the warehouse for goods to be transported inside, shortening the queuing time; some movable shelves were added and more personnel were assigned to sort out the vegetables and fruits, reducing the waste by 30%. The space utilization rate was also increased by a good 20%. Laura convinced others what she could do with her outstanding management skills. More mega communities began to learn from the good practices in logistics and transportation.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251049=A baby's cry sounded in the pitch-black woods. That was how newborn Marlen announced her arrival to the world in her blankets. The cries that should have aroused her parents' love and affection, attracted a red-eyed beast - a scarred gray wolf - from the forest instead. After her mate's death in a battle against the king of the wolves, the lone wolf lost her cubs and was expelled from the pack. In desperate need of food, she knew that she would be a meal for other beasts if she failed to fill her stomach. Luckily, she found a vulnerable prey - a human baby. \nAs a bloody mouth approached, Marlen, unaware of the imminent danger, moaned as if pleading for her mother to hold her, as she sensed the warmth of the wolf's breath. The cub-like sound made the wolf falter. She retracted her fangs and moved closer to Marlen, sniffing her repeatedly, as if to tell whether or not she was the cub she had lost. A moment later, she opened her mouth again. This time, she didn't do it to snap Marlen's neck, but instead took her under her belly and began to lick the poor child. The thin milk mixed with the blood from the wolf's wounds became Marlen's first meal in the world. In the warmth of the embrace, Marlen gradually quieted down. It was at this moment that the instinct of motherly love overcame the predatory nature. The wild wolf became a mother and Marlen had a family. \nFeeding on wolf's milk and raw meat, Marlen grew up in the wild. She didn't have the chance to learn how to walk or speak like a human, but with her mother's guidance, she developed a keen intuition like a wild animal and excellent hunting and trapping skills. Although Marlen was somewhat puzzled by the fact that her sparse fur was so different from that of her mother's, the difference in appearance didn't make her less dependent on her mother. She was deeply attached to her mother, and also equally attached to the forest where she grew up. \nThe invasion of the human world by the zombie virus, however, and the dwindling resources of living, caused a lot of people to set their eyes on the forest, where both opportunities and challenges remained. One day, a squad of gun-toting adventurers walked into the forest. Marlen, who was lurking in the bushes from afar, saw them.\nThis type of "animal" with two legs and standing upright was something she had never seen before. They had the same limbs and appearance as herself but spoke a totally unintelligible language. Marlen's eyes were filled with human-like curiosity. \n"What is that, prey? Or an enemy?' \nMarlen was puzzled, yet the similarity in appearance made her begin to mimic their movements. She copied the man with the gun in the distance, slowly raising her own hand, stretching it, clenching her fist, and then tentatively reaching for the stone on the ground. As her five fingers slowly clenched together, Marlen grasped something for the first time. the cold touch of the stone in her palm startled Marlen, who dropped it in a hurry. Without bothering to finish her hunting plans for the day, she went back towards the cave to find her mother. \nHer mother, who was already in her old age, didn't have much to show for today's hunt. After a busy day, she only brought back a small, thin hare. Seeing that Marlen, who had returned to the cave without a gain, she did not get angry. Rather, she limped over to Marlen and got down beside her, using her tongue to clean up the shreds of Marlen's hair. Her mother's embrace gradually calmed Marlen. She wrapped her arms around her mother, repeating over and over in her mind. \n"I'm my mother's child, I'm my mother's child..."\nBut today's imitation of that two-legged animal grasping a rock lingered in her mind. A voice sounded in Marlen's mind:\n"Maybe the creature I saw today has something to do with myself..."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  251050=When talking about Irma, people in the tribe all marveled at her incredible strength. Carrying logs and digging up ore...the time-consuming and labor-intensive work for ordinary people was as simple as eating and drinking in Irma's eyes. The aged chief also complimented that thanks to Irma, the tribe was able to regain its foothold in the doomsday, which suggested that he considered Irma to be a capable candidate for the next chief.\n"Guys, get up!! It's an earthquake! Quake's coming!"\nIt was late at night when the people in deep sleep were awakened by Irma's loud voice. Before they could have time to realize what actually happened, deafening tremors came. Beds creaked and shook; walls crumbled; as soon as people fled from their homes to the tribal plaza, the dust rolled off the mountains in the distance. Even the sacred stone that always stood at the top of the mountain range fell along with the falling debris.\n"Look! Our sacred stone...the sacred stone has fallen!"\n"No! The falling of the sacred stone...marks the end of our tribe!!"\nAs the crowd exclaimed, the sacred stone, which was part of the faith of the tribe, tumbled down, becoming the last straw that overwhelmed everyone. Everyone was wailing and whining as if they had already seen the future of the tribe's downfall. The warriors who had gone to investigate the situation came back one after another, reporting the latest findings with their heads drooping in despair.\n"Bad news, folks. The sacred stone cut off the river. We tried to destroy or move it, but it was just too hard to move it an inch. By next week at the very latest, or three days at the soonest, our tribe's water source will completely dry up."\n"Things were just picking up these days... Now my tribe is doomed like this."\n"Without water, we couldn't survive for many days."\n"Where else can we go in this sheer wilderness."\nAs the sadness pervaded the crowd, Irma stood out in the silence. "There must be a way. It's not the time to give up yet. Wait, I'll take a look up there."\nThe solid rock indeed sank into the muddy river. Irma attempted to push it, but even with her immense strength, she could only make the sacred stone shake a bit. It was obviously impossible to get the sacred stone out of the way. Irma stared at the stone for quite a while. Suddenly, she clenched her fists and punched the stone with all her force.\n*Creaking... A huge crack miraculously appeared in the center of the sacred stone and quickly widened out.\n"Whatever stone it is, only those that don't get in the way are good stones." Irma, who had successfully tackled the problem, clapped her hands. "But it's hard to find such a hard stone. Guess I'll make a weapon out of it. That would be good enough for a solid stone like this."</div></div></div>
