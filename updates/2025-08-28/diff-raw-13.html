Being here for the first time must be a little overwhelming. Worry not. Here is your first-day guide that will help you know the Fortress better. Let's begin with the Facilities which will help you settle in more comfortably!\n\n[Control Center]\nThe backbone of the Fortress. Upgrade the Control Center to unlock more facilities and new content. \nNew Fortress skins will be unlocked when your Fortress reaches certain levels.\n\n[Entrance Hall]\nUpgrade the Entrance Hall to raise your Fortress's Wall Condition \nand build an even more impenetrable Fortress!\n\n[Laboratory]\nUpgrade the Laboratory to unlock more powerful technologies!\n\n[Stone Quarry, Iron Mine, and Coal Mine]\nUpgrade Mines and Quarries to allow your people to acquire resources more efficiently.\n\n[Gym, Sparring Room, and Shooting Range]\nIt's a good idea to always have your soldiers ready.

Best regards from Last Fortress!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">314138=Fortress Guide [Day 2]</div><div class="diff-line ctx">314139=Finding the right direction and things to do when first arriving in this new world might be confusing. Today's guide might just be the help you need!\n[Heroes]\nYou can't develop your Fortress without Production Heroes and Combat Heroes.\nProduction Heroes come from all over the world, each with their own area of expertise. Send them to the facilities that will put their talents to good use.\nCombat Heroes, on the other hand, can be put in APCs to lead troops and perform various tasks.\n\n[Exploration]\nDeploy Combat Heroes in Exploration Battles to gain abundant resources needed for Gear and Hero upgrades.\nThere are even Exploration Rewards you can accumulate as you progress in Exploration. You can check your rank in the Exploration Leaderboard.\n\n[Mission]\nFollow the main missions and daily missions to find the next thing to do in the game.\nComplete them to get plentiful rewards and Moon Points, which can help you get even more resources!\n\nThat's all for today's guide. Don't forget to check them out in the game!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">314140=Fortress Guide [Day 3]</div><div class="diff-line ctx">314141=Hello again, Commander. Today's guide is about Alliance and benefits you can't miss. Hope it will be helpful to your Fortress development.\n\n[Alliance]\nJoin an Alliance to face the doomsday challenge with your allies, or you can always create one yourself and make your own rules.\nMembers of the same Alliance can help each other, allowing you to construct faster and more efficiently. As an Alliance member, you can even claim other rewards.\nNew content, rewards, and allies await you in an Alliance. Go join one now!\n\n[VIP Level and Privilege]\nGrow your Fortress faster by upgrading your VIP level to get powerful buffs, more resources, and speed boosts in construction.\nDon't forget to claim your daily VIP Points. The higher the consecutive login days, the more VIP points you'll obtain!\nThere is even an exclusive VIP chest you can open every day. The higher your VIP level, the more rewards it contains!\n\nThat's all for today's guide. Go join an Alliance now and participate in the Alliance events. You don't want to miss all those rewards!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">314142=Fortress Guide [Day 4]</div><div class="diff-line ctx">314143=We meet again, Commander! Today you'll learn about some important events in the game.\n\nThere are many events worth participating in. However, the following three events are highly recommended for newcomers, as they produce rich rewards with little effort required.\n\n[Cheetah Warrior's Treasure]\nThere are mysterious legends in this doomsday world, and Kin Ogawa, the Cheetah Warrior, is one of them.\nRumor has it that he is so fast and powerful that he can silence his enemies the instant he unsheathes his sword.\nParticipate in the event and log in for seven days to obtain this Hero!\n\n[Doomsday Warpath]\nThe event will be challenging, but once you go through and complete the missions, you'll get an Advanced Elite Hero—Wolowitz.\nWolowitz is a senior engineer who can help with your Fortress development.\nComplete the missions and earn yourself a reliable assistant!\n\n[Doomsday Survival Contest]\nMany unknown risks and also opportunities exist outside the Fortress. To better understand this world, participate in Doomsday Survival Contest!\nJoin an Alliance and compete with your allies for the all-knowing title!\n\nThat's all for today's guide. Don't forget to log in daily and participate in those events to get rich rewards!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">314144=The passage of time failed to snuff its fading glory. The legend will continue, provided you repair it first, that is.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">314145=Rules\n1. Chariot Components can be used to repair Chariots. Commanders can complete the repair to get the Chariot.\n2. Ways to get Chariot Components: Killing zombies, purchasing packs and participating in certain events.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">314146=Fortress Guide [Day 5]</div><div class="diff-line ctx">314147=Hi again, Commander. After familiarising yourself with this world over the past few days, let's explore outside the Fortress today.\n\n[Resource Gathering]\nMany mines are scattered worldwide and provide an inexhaustible supply of resources.\nThe higher the level of a mine, the richer its resource reserves will be. Sending Heroes tagged with "Gather" to gather resources will improve the Lineup's Gathering Load and Gathering Speed.\n\n[Common Zombie]\nWhen confronted with hordes of zombies, work together and keep safe!\nFind zombies on the world map. Defeat them to get rich rewards!\n\n[Mutated Zombie]\nMutated Zombies in sight! They are extremely powerful and can only be attacked by a group of players. Now go rally your allies!\n\n[War]\nMake your conquest after the world map is unlocked.\nAttack other players for resources to grow your Fortress.\nA little tip: Weigh the risk and scout your opponent's Fortress before launching any attack.\n\nKeep your Fortress safe while attacking others.\nBefore going offline for an extended period, always ensure your Fortress is secure to prevent your hard-earned resources from being looted by others!\n\nGive it a try and explore the world map! I'll see you tomorrow!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">314148=Fortress Guide [Day 7]</div><div class="diff-line ctx">314149=Hello, Commander! Can't believe a week has passed since we first met. Here is your last Fortress guide.\n\nBy now, you must have captured some territories. Let's take a look at how to run your estates properly!\n\n[Alliance Territory]\nCities captured by the Alliance, the results of joint efforts, will be displayed in Territory under Alliance.\nAn Alliance will be rewarded with Season Rewards according to the highest-level cities it captures, so don't be shy to challenge for rich rewards and earn glory with your allies!\n\n[Merits]\nThe Merit Shop will be available after cities are unlocked. You can get Merits by battling on the world map.\nThere is a limit to how many Merits you can earn per week, and the limit is reset every Friday at 0:00. Redeem your rewards using Merits at the Alliance Shop, where precious items and Heroes await you!\n\nThat's all for the Fortress guide. Good luck, and may you walk your own path in the game!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">314150=15-min speed-up</div><div class="diff-line ctx">314151=Memento Coin</div><div class="diff-line ctx">314152=Samurai Fujiwara</div><div class="diff-line ctx">314153=Elite Hero Medal</div><div class="diff-line ctx">314154=Samurai Fujiwara</div><div class="diff-line ctx">314155=Advanced Gear</div><div class="diff-line ctx">314156=Samurai Fujiwara *2</div><div class="diff-line ctx">314157=Fortress in Guard</div><div class="diff-line ctx">314158=Always stay alert and protect your Fortress in this post-apocalyptic world where danger lurks!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">314159=The Placement Area is where you can move Guardian Turrets, swap their positions and upgrade one by merging two of the same level.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">314160=The zombies in the Movement Area will move one tile to the left with every step you take.

Come, for your Easter gift – a special edition of Easter egg by Emma." Brady handed the gift to N.A.T.E yet he didn’t take it like he usually would. \n "N.A.T.E?" \nN.A.T.E heard that Easter eggs can hatch rabbits. N.A.T.E is a machine and therefore not suitable for caring for living things.” \n “It’s just a fairy tale," Brady smiled and put the egg in N.A.T.E's hands, “Yet I believe you will get a new life and become a living person with this Easter egg.” \n "N.A.T.E, alive... the data analysis failed... yet N.A.T.E is looking forward to it”</div><div class="diff-line ctx">316321=Recently, Natalie seemed not herself as she was hiding in the house all day.

It turned out that Natalie was practising drawing on eggs secretly. \n"Unexpectedly, it turns out that Natalie also has things that she’s not good at. "\nEmma looked through the crack of the door at Natalie's hands, which were steady when aiming at zombies yet clumsy at drawing, putting drawings that were hard to recognize on the eggs. Emma sneered a few times with her mouth covered and took a photo to keep as a souvenir.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">316322=The entire fortress is surrounded by various Easter eggs drawn by everyone as Easter is approaching. They were hoping to receive the blessing from the Goddess of Life today, so that they could farewell the Apocalypse and greet their new beginnings. \nBrady sat in a quiet corner, staring at the crowd celebrating the holiday. He would never imagine he would come across and celebrate a holiday with a group of people one day. \nUnfortunately, his wife and daughter didn’t have the chance to see today for themselves. \n Eggs blocked Brady's sight and Natalie appeared in front of him out of the blue, “It’s for you." \n"I am in my forties and too old for this kind of gift that makes children happy." Brady waved his hand, the colourful eggs are simply incompatible with his mature appearance. \n"It's not to make children happy, rather, a blessing.” Natalie's tone is serious, "I wish the living health, and I also wish the dead...rest in peace." \n“...Thank you." Brady took the egg, and the bitterness on the tip of his tongue was slightly covered by the sweetness of the melted candy."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">316323=In the kitchen, Emma was thinking about how to make eggs with the only ingredients available at the end of the world. A round figure sneaked into the kitchen and stretched out his hand towards the cutting board. \n "Fernando, you want to steal food again! "Emma patted Fernando's hand away angrily, and a black thing fell out. \n"This is... chocolate? ！ "\n"Hey, this is my last collection. "Fernando shook his big belly and said proudly: "To hold back from eating it, I have lost a little weight."\n"I really didn't notice it. "Emma looked at Fernando up and down: ”Then what are you doing in the kitchen, showing off how precious your collection is?" "\nFernando didn't understand Emma's sarcasm, and put the chocolate next to the eggshell: "I heard that you are making Easter eggs. What could be more suitable than chocolate~ After all, food is delicious. You still have to enjoy it together. Delicious." \nThe Easter limited menu was successfully launched, and people were surprised to find that the name Fernando was added to the list of cooking chefs.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">316324="Keyword extraction...

"\n Natalie hid the badly painted egg behind her, "Um...to work." \n "To eat, to draw, to work... Analysis failed, the analysis failed,” the three completely irrelevant answers confusing N.A.T.E's data.\n"N.A.T.E, what's wrong with you?" \n"Brady, what is Easter? The answers that were given by everyone were different I can't comprehend them."\n After listening to the answers N.A.T.E collected from everyone, Brady laughed and took Nat to the lively hall. In the hall, everyone performed their duties and arranged the event venue, but there were always smiles on their faces. \n"The answers are all part of Easter, but the most important thing is that they can make everyone feel happy in these processes and rekindle their expectations for the future.

Either a can of canned food or a piece of clothing, common daily necessities in ordinary times, are packaged as gifts for others, they are given special value. \nUnfortunately, the cheerful exchange of gifts seemed to have nothing to do with Natalie, who was cold and silent. She rarely communicated with other people in the fortress. There was no one she could call a friend. She walked through the crowd in silence and returned to her room. \n "Happy Easter! "As soon as she opened the door, Natalie was so frightened by the sudden sound of fireworks that she almost reflexively picked up the gun. Brady, Fernando, and Emma were all in the house, holding gifts to congratulate Natalie. \n Natalie was suddenly at a loss. She turned her head to hide her strange expression, but her red ears betrayed her. \n"Thank you... my friends."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">316326=Unknown Paint</div><div class="diff-line ctx">316327=During the event, you can get any one of the following paints: yellow paint, red paint, green paint, blue paint, silver paint</div><div class="diff-line ctx">316328=Yellow Paint Card</div><div class="diff-line ctx">316329=Happy Easter!
