Unlike the places full of zombies and enemies outside, people in here seem to have forgotten the troubles of survival and are immersed in this long-lost peaceful festival. At this moment, even Natalie the cold has joined to decorate the Christmas tree, while Fernando and Emma are tussling at the dining table; it's incredible to Brady to see all of this. \n\n Survival is not the biggest issue now compared to just a few months ago when they moved into the fortress, his main concern has become when to exterminate the zombies and get back to the ground.\n\n"Hey, don't worry about it.", Natalie patting Brady's shoulder, "I've seen what you are thinking." \nN.A.T.E comes over as well, "According to the analysis, there are 178,023 fortresses celebrating Christmas today." \n\n"Look!" Fernando's voice comes from upstairs, "Look outside! The fortresses are shining like stars in the sky!" \n"Idiot," said Emma, " these stars are not as bright as ours even their lights stack up together. Our fortress is the brightest star!"</div><div class="diff-line ctx">370629="Anyone want to have some candy?" Fernando shook the candy in his hand, "I just bought from the helicopter, Christmas special!" \n"What's a Christmas special? N.A.T.E doesn't understand.” \n"It's some candy that's only sold at Christmas, you claim yourself an intelligent robot and you don't even what candy is?" \n"Emma, you can't laugh at a robot! That's not cool!" Brady shook his head, they are not acting like any grown-ups. \n "Let me take a look." Natalie looked at candy in Fernando's hands, "I want to have this." \n"I didn't even know you like candy cane, that's another side of Natalie." Fernando laughed. \nNatalie held up the candy cane and posed it like a gun, "Say that again and watch out for me hitting you with a candy gun." \n\nSnap. From N.A.T.E comes the sound of a camera. "Christmas special photo."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">370630="Transporting...Christmas decorations have been transported...by 50%"\n"Christmas decorations......have been collected......by 30%" \n"N.A.T.E has competed 1,326 transportation missions at a speed of 2m/s, helped 57 people. \n\n"Stop. N.A.T.E , stop." Fernando patted N.A.T.E on the head, "You are a big help today!", came Brady's voice, " Fernando, come and give me a hand on moving these crates!" \nFernando walked to the warehouse with N.A.T.E following him. "N.A.T.E , go back to charge yourself.", said Fernando, "I can't move you if you stop working halfway." \n"N.A.T.E copies", then it moved slowly to the Charging Station. \n\n As Brady and Fernando were resting in the kitchen, N.A.T.E came back in. "Intelligent robot is at your service.", N.A.T.E served them milk, "Record, Fernando and Brady are over exercised, they need to rest and have some water." \n\n N.A.T.E turned back to the Charging Station, "Record, Fernando and Brady are N.A.T.E's friends."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">370631=People in the Fortress have been preparing for the Christmas as of lately. Some started to drink, some knitted Christmas scarves and some are decorating the Christmas Tree. However, Natalie acted as if she ignored all of that, still doing the same training every day, caring for her gun. It seemed that this holiday has nothing to do with her. \n\nEmma sighed, looking at the loner. \n\nNext day when Natalie woke up, she found Christmas stocking hanging over her bed, with a box of present inside. It was some necessary items for gun maintenance after she opened it. Natalie looked around, seeing Emma averting her eyes deliberately, walking to the kitchen. \n\n"Thank you.", whispered Natalie. \n\nEmma paused, "You're welcome."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">370632=Christmas is here. Brady looked at the distant moonlight and wondered when the last time he'd had a Christmas. He sighed and lit a cigarette. That's when he turned his head and saw Natalie was also on the roof, polishing her pistol in the moonlight, the skill was like from a veteran who had been fighting for years. \n\nThis young lady, about the same age as my daughter, what she had been through..... Brady thought inwardly and exhaled a puff of smoke. By this time Natalie had put her gun away. Without a word, she went downstairs, brought up two beers, and handed one to Brady. \n\nThey looked at each other and clinked their glasses in silence, like two color balls of Christmas, gently collided. It wasn't easy to have a peaceful Christmas, so why reminisce about the bitterness of the past!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">370633=This the first time Emma has spent Christmas after the fall of the 'castle'. A little cozier than expected, she thought, thanks to the Fortress that gave her a place in this world. It would be even better if there weren't chubby Fernando grabbing food from her. \n\n Thought to herself as she looked at Fernando who was rummaging through the kitchen for food and said, "Mr. Fernando, are you going to make a big show of cooking Christmas dinner in a place like this?" Fernando didn't realize it was a taunt and responded delightfully, "My favorite thing about Christmas is that I used to decorate Christmas tree when I was a kid!" "Was your Christmas tree knocked over by a round belly?" Emma laughed. But Fernando didn't seem offended, as he said, "It's all because Emma's so good at cooking. I couldn't spare my tummy." \n\n Emma listened and stunned. She fished out a bell from storage and handed it to Fernando, "Then you'll have to come help with the Christmas tree decorations this year."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">370634=Purchased:</div><div class="diff-line ctx">370635=Ask your friend for one</div><div class="diff-line ctx">370636=Ask again after {0}</div><div class="diff-line ctx">370637=Can't gift yourself any card!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">370638=Please select a Commander first</div><div class="diff-line ctx">370639=Arming Up</div><div class="diff-line ctx">370640=Arm yourself well, before the first ray of light appears!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">370641=After the sheer darkness will be the dawn!
