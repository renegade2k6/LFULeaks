During the event, you can receive the daily check-in rewards when logging into the game.\n2. If you log in but do not claim the rewards for some reason, don't worry, you can still claim them the next time you log in.\nExample: You log in from December 1st to December 5th, but do not claim any check-in rewards. On December 6th, you can collect all the rewards from December 1st to December 6th.\n3. If you forget to log in on a day, don' panic, you can spend a certain number of Diamonds to make up for the missed day.\n4. The first time you try to make up for a missed check-in, you need to pay 50 Diamonds only; in the subsequent attempts, however, you'll need to spend 50 Diamonds more than the previous time, with the amount capped at 500 Diamonds.\n5. After receiving the reward of the day, you can claim it once again by making a purchase. (the following items cannot be claimed again through making purchases: heroes, hero shards, emotes, avatar frames, fortress appearances, nameplates, etc.) \n6. By making a purchase, you can only claim the reward for the same day again; that is to say, the purchase will not grant you another reward for the day on which you log in but do not claim the reward, or the day you make up for.\n7. There are rewards for consecutive check-in for 3/7/10 days. During the event, each consecutive check-in reward can only be received once.\n8. The duration for each consecutive check-in is calculated independently. After completing 3 days of consecutive check-in, you'll start from day one for 7 days of consecutive check-in challenge. A day will still count towards the consecutive check-in days even if you do not claim the reward of that day.\nExample: You complete check-in from December 1st to 8th, but you do not claim the consecutive check-in rewards. After you claim the rewards for 3 days of consecutive check-in, you'll be considered to have checked in for 5 days in the 7-day consecutive check-in challenge.\n9. Rewards (for daily check-in + consecutive check-in) not claimed in time will be sent to your mailbox after the event ends. \n10.

Yeti will appear randomly in the world at 0:00, 8:00 and 16:00 every day, with each round lasting for 1 hour, please go to check in time\n3. The commander can attack the Yeti individually or launch a rally attack. The more damage you deal to it, the more points you will earn. When assembling, the points are calculated based on the total DMG of the team.\n4. The single attack damage ranking list and the historical damage ranking list only count the single attack damage of a single commander.\n5. After defeating the low-level Yeti, the attackable Yeti will level up, and so will the rewards.\n6.

During the event (Dec 1st, 2023 00:00:00 - Dec 31st, 23:59:59), log into the game to start accumulating the time you stay online. For every 30 minutes of accumulated online time, you can claim a Reindeer Chest.\n2. Only when you're online can you add to the accumulated online time, which means the online time will not increase while you are offline.\n3. You can collect the Reindeer Chest up to 4 times a day. After all chests are collected, the online time of the day will cease to increase.\n4. Each time you collect a Reindeer Chest, you will gain 10 EXP. When the EXP reaches a certain level, the Reindeer will be leveled up.\n5. As the level of the Reindeer increases, the Chest level will also increase. The higher the Chest level, the better rewards you can possibly get.\n6. If a chest is available for collecting, you'll need to collect it first before starting to accumulate time for the next chest, otherwise, the accumulated time will pause at the current chest.\n7. After collecting a Chest, the accumulated time will be zeroed and the accumulation for the next chest will start from scratch.\nEXAMPLE: If you log out after 20 minutes and 05 seconds accumulated, when logging back in, the online time will keep accumulating from 20 minutes and 05 seconds.\n8. The time can be accumulated across two days, but the number of attempts for collecting Chests won't be accumulated across different days.\n9. If you fail to collect the Chest after you have reached the required online time and collect it the next day, one attempt will be reduced from the number of attempts on the day of claiming.\nEXAMPLE: Say you stay online for 30 minutes in total on December 1st and can claim 1 Reindeer Chest, but you do not collect it on that day. When you log in on Dec 2nd to collect that Chest, you will consume one attempt out of the 4 attempts of Dec 2nd.\n10. Please keep an eye on the timer for the Reindeer Chests displayed on the page in the Control Center.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  900705=1. During the event, complete missions to win due rewards and points. \n2. After the event starts, missions of the day will be unlocked in order. \n3. Once you earn enough points by completing missions, you'll be able to claim progress rewards. \n4. Each mission can only be completed once during the event. \n5. Unclaimed progress and mission rewards will be delivered to you via mail after the event ends.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  900706=1. During the event, use Spacetime Hero Points to draw the rewards displayed on the event page. \n2. When drawing rewards, you will earn some points based on the Spacetime Hero Points you spend. Once the points reach a certain level, you'll be able to claim progress rewards. Each progress reward can only be claimed once during the event. \n3. On the event page, you can see the odds of each reward through the "Probabilities" info. \n4. Fixed rewards are in the golden vortex, while custom rewards are in the red vortex. Fixed rewards won't change; custom rewards can be selected and refreshed by tapping "change". \n5. Changing the custom rewards will not affect the accumulation of points. The odds of each reward after the change can be viewed on the "Probabilities" page. \n6. You can enjoy a discount on your first draw. The discount is only available once during the event. Please refer to the event page for the specific event duration. \n7. Ticking "Skip the animation" will hide all the animations for the lucky draw until you untick the option.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  900707=Yeti appears!
