But there's one thing we know for sure -- we are about to usher in a new era!</div><div class="diff-line add">246420=Calm down. Their wounds are weird. Better check it out.</div><div class="diff-line add">246421=I bet she can't hear it. What about one month's ration of Sizzling Gophers as the stake?</div><div class="diff-line add">246422=Let's go, buds! After this, I'll buy you roasted Gophers, as much as you want!</div><div class="diff-line add">246423=Copy that. I'll locate where it is as fast as possible.</div><div class="diff-line add">246424=Wooo! It's gonna be the war to end all wars?</div><div class="diff-line add">246425=Glad to know you feel that way, Mr. Brom. Welcome!</div><div class="diff-line add">246426=Thanks, I am more concerned about what you need me to do. I used to be a mercenary.</div><div class="diff-line add">246427=It's clear that one can't survive without some skills these days.</div><div class="diff-line add">246428=There are still many secrets hidden here. We need people like you to explore them with us.</div><div class="diff-line add">246429=I'll leave the trap here and go have a rest. Hope I could see a Gopher in the trap tomorrow morning.</div><div class="diff-line add">246430=Now we have workers in the Mine. We'll be able to collect some Stones tomorrow. Now we may go have a rest.</div><div class="diff-line add">246431=Place the Mushroom Box here and go get some sleep. We'll have enough food to eat tomorrow.</div><div class="diff-line add">247001=Check out what I found! There's a garage right under the Entrance Hall!</div><div class="diff-line add">247002=Looks like it'll need some repairs though.</div><div class="diff-line add">247003=Consider it done!</div><div class="diff-line add">247004=Heavens, what's that piled up over there?</div><div class="diff-line add">247005=Visitor detected. Diagnostics mode activated.</div><div class="diff-line add">247006=30%......57%......scan complete. Damage report: 23% of core energy remaining......low battery mode activated.</div><div class="diff-line add">247007=It's a robot!</div><div class="diff-line add">247008=N.A.T.E at your service. I can do tasks, such as gathering, distributing, storage, and many more.</div><div class="diff-line add">247009=Last activation for service. 5000 hours ago. Service target......Error. Data lost.</div><div class="diff-line add">247010=Don't worry buddy. This is your new home now. Welcome!</div><div class="diff-line add">247011=Hard to believe such a small machine can carry that many supplies.</div><div class="diff-line add">247012=Hear that N.A.T.E? The ever-so spiteful Emma is actually complimenting y—N.A.T.E!</div><div class="diff-line add">247013=N.A.T.E! Oh no, it shut off! Poor buddy...</div><div class="diff-line add">247014=Don't worry, it's just out of power. It'll be back up and running again when we find a way to power him up.</div><div class="diff-line add">247015=I hope that day comes soon!</div><div class="diff-line add">247016=Our Heroes are short of soldiers. Please replenish more.</div><div class="diff-line add">247017=Facing the strong enemy, we need to ensure that each Hero leads at least one soldier.</div><div class="diff-line add">247018=Replenish soldiers and get prepared.</div><div class="diff-line add">247019=There're toxic gases and pollution everywhere. We'd better be careful with every step we take.</div><div class="diff-line add">247020=Same strategy. We move towards Eden inch by inch.</div><div class="diff-line add">247021=I got a file here. Perhaps we can find some clues in it.</div><div class="diff-line add">247022=Looks like these are some survival experience left by someone.</div><div class="diff-line add">247023=We need to capture a Lv. 1 city first. Then capture more territories and move towards Eden little by little.</div><div class="diff-line add">247024=Maybe we can build some Facilities out of these minerals to shield us from the pollution, and keep our territory connected.</div><div class="diff-line add">247025=Tap to view rules on other pages.</div><div class="diff-line add">247026=Tap here to close the rule page</div><div class="diff-line add">247027=After figuring out how to play, let's get started in the new season!</div><div class="diff-line add">248001=I saw someone special at the door.</div><div class="diff-line add">248002=Special? How special?</div><div class="diff-line add">248003=With no gun, the guy blew a zombie's head off with bare fists.</div><div class="diff-line add">248004=Check if he got other weapons. Then bring him to me.</div><div class="diff-line add">248005=Hey, guys... Fernando? You're alive?! Thought you already turned into one of those things!</div><div class="diff-line add">248006=You bastard, Beesly! Who do you think I am?</div><div class="diff-line add">248007=You know him? Who is he, Fernando?</div><div class="diff-line add">248008=An old villain. Messing around and scamming people everywhere.</div><div class="diff-line add">248009=Heh. C'mon. I wasn't that bad. I used to be a boxing coach.</div><div class="diff-line add">248010=Yep. Boxing coach! The one who ran away with all my money for "boxing lessons."</div><div class="diff-line add">248011=Wait, did I? There must be something wrong. I'll give you back all your money and interests. I promise!</div><div class="diff-line add">248012=Welcome, Laura. May I know what you did in the past for a living?</div><div class="diff-line add">248013=I used to work for a logistics company. I also have a van. Glad to lend a hand if you need help.</div><div class="diff-line add">248016=Which is to say, we can go back to the ground more often?</div><div class="diff-line add">248017=Of course, Fernando.</div><div class="diff-line add">248018=Thanks, Laura. We'll count on you to collect resources up there.</div><div class="diff-line add">248019=Thank you for opening the door for me. You really saved my life.</div><div class="diff-line add">248020=Don't be so modest. A couple of zombies like that ain't a problem for you. Are they, Ms. Sharpshooter?</div><div class="diff-line add">248021=Do I know you?</div><div class="diff-line add">248022=We're actually from the same area. Heard of your name years ago. After all, everyone knew we had a shooting champion.</div><div class="diff-line add">248023=That's right, Pamela. I even have your autograph!</div><div class="diff-line add">248024=Alright. But that was really a close one. I got only one bullet left.</div><div class="diff-line add">248025=Haha. No need to worry about that here. Are you interested in being our coach for shooting?</div><div class="diff-line add">248026=With pleasure.</div><div class="diff-line add">248027=Voila. This is the Fortress. How do you think, Fiona?</div><div class="diff-line add">248028=Not bad. The place's much better than the warehouse.</div><div class="diff-line add">248029=Trust me. The longer you stay here, the more you'll like it.</div><div class="diff-line add">248030=So, let's get down to business. What do you need from me?</div><div class="diff-line add">248031=Alright. As you can see, we're expanding the place at the moment...</div><div class="diff-line add">248032=Simply put, we need you to do what you did when training the Minutemen.</div><div class="diff-line add">248033=Sure. But to be frank, my way of training is way beyond what is called "cruel."</div><div class="diff-line add">248034=I see. You may adopt whatever training you want, so long as we have good fighters.</div><div class="diff-line add">248035=Morning, guys!</div><div class="diff-line add">248036=Geez! Where did she come from?</div><div class="diff-line add">248037=Who are you?</div><div class="diff-line add">248038=Forgot my voice already? We had a satellite call last night!</div><div class="diff-line add">248039=That can't be real! You were like 20 km away when calling. We planned to rescue you early this morning.</div><div class="diff-line add">248040=I would say I'm much stronger than you thought. As a fitness coach, I would never be dwarfed by half a marathon.</div><div class="diff-line add">248041=On another note, you really gotta check out the security issue. No one saw me while I tried to get in.</div><div class="diff-line add">248042=That's because zombies, generally speaking, cannot get over the wall.</div><div class="diff-line add">248043=Tell me you don't really think zombie is your only enemy, sweetheart.</div><div class="diff-line add">248044=Remember, in the post-apocalypse world, humans can be more dreadful than zombies.</div><div class="diff-line add">248045=Well. The good news is, from today on, I'll help you work on the defense with what I can do.</div><div class="diff-line add">248046=Brady, I'm fed up with Dr. Luke!!</div><div class="diff-line add">248047=Dr. Luke? What's going on?</div><div class="diff-line add">248048=What's going on? Look at all the mess here. Thanks to the great Dr. Luke!</div><div class="diff-line add">248051=You know what? He said the pot was his invention. And almost poured the Gopher soup on me!</div><div class="diff-line add">248053=Calm down, Emma. Perhaps the genius is supposed to be different from ordinary people in a way?</div><div class="diff-line add">248054=What? You're "infected" by him or what? Or I'm the one who's gone mad?</div><div class="diff-line add">248055=Heh, easy. I know he's kinda lunatic sometimes, but he did fix lots of things for us.</div><div class="diff-line add">248056=Obviously, he's a genius. He only seemed to have been frightened by something.</div><div class="diff-line add">248057=Trust me. Simply keep him in the Lab, and he'll bring us one miracle after another.</div><div class="diff-line add">248058=Hey, look! Where did the statue in the Diner come from?</div><div class="diff-line add">248059=Beware of where you touch, my friend. That's my work.</div><div class="diff-line add">248060=Who are you?! I've never seen you before!</div><div class="diff-line add">248061=No panic. This is my friend. He got here last night. You all went to bed at that time.</div><div class="diff-line add">248062=Now let me introduce Pheidias to you. He's a sculptor.</div><div class="diff-line add">248063=Sculptor? Can't believe there's still sculptor in such a doomed world.</div><div class="diff-line add">248064=Do you mean we'll have many more statues like this in the Fortress?</div><div class="diff-line add">248065=Of course not. I made it to study the texture of the Stones here.</div><div class="diff-line add">248066=Texture of Stones? Sorry, I still don't get it. Why we need to know that?</div><div class="diff-line add">248067=Pheidias is more than a sculptor. He knows mining and constructing well. You'll be surprised by how much he can do.</div><div class="diff-line add">248068=Brady, good to see you again! Glad to know you're alive.</div><div class="diff-line add">248069=So do I, man.</div><div class="diff-line add">248070=Another old friend of you?</div><div class="diff-line add">248071=Bingo! I was just about to introduce to you my old partner -- Pearson, the architect.</div><div class="diff-line add">248072=I was the designer for the defense structure of the "castle." Sadly, it didn't survive the zombie wave.</div><div class="diff-line add">248073=Now you have a good chance to stop living on with remorse. We do need a good architect here.</div><div class="diff-line add">248074=Thanks, bud. I'll do my best. You have my words.</div><div class="diff-line add">248075=Beesly is my old friend. He used to be a fight trainer and can teach you some self-defense skills.</div><div class="diff-line add">248076=There is no such a word as "surrender" in my dictionary!</div><div class="diff-line add">248077=I heard you want to learn how to beat an enemy. Let me teach you a thing or two. Don't panic. I'll be gentle.</div><div class="diff-line add">248078=Welcome on board, Laura! I wonder if you'd mind lending the car to us for collecting suplies?</div><div class="diff-line add">248079=No problem. Let me take care of this. Don't forget I'm an old driver!</div><div class="diff-line add">248080=Welcome aboard, Pamela! I heard you were a shooting champion. Wanna become a shooting instructor?</div><div class="diff-line add">248081=Happy to help! As long as there are enough bullets, I'll train everyone into a sharpshooter.</div><div class="diff-line add">248082=Welcome aboard, Instructor Fiona. I'll be counting on you for future military training missions.</div><div class="diff-line add">248083=Leave it to me! Only one problem - I hope my "ogrish training" doesn't scare people away.</div><div class="diff-line add">248084=Welcome aboard, Miss Lori. I've heard you're a professional fitness instructor?</div><div class="diff-line add">248085=Yes, life is about exercise and I will help y'all develop the most scientific workout plan.</div><div class="diff-line add">248086=Welcome aboard, Dr. Luke, I'm sure you'll enjoy it here.</div><div class="diff-line add">248087=Haha, of course! Separate labs, quiet surroundings... just perfect for research!</div><div class="diff-line add">248088=Just wait and see! I'll turn this place into a technological fortress as long as giving me enough materials and time.</div><div class="diff-line add">248089=Welcome aboard, Pheidias. May I ask what you are specialized in?</div><div class="diff-line add">248090=My specialties are mining and building. Hope I can help!</div><div class="diff-line add">248091=I've heard a lot about you, Pearson! We're still talking a lot about your building a community of the living.</div><div class="diff-line add">248092=That's been a while ago! However, I think I can help if you need an architect here.</div><div class="diff-line add">251000=[Profile]\nFaction: Minutemen\nProfession: Sniper\nSex: F\nAge: 25\nHeight: 165cm\nWeight: 58kg\nNationality: Russian\nBlood Type: A\nBirthday: May 9\n[Experience]\nAbandoned by her parents when she was young, Rebecca was adopted by an ill-tempered binge drinker. Worse still, there were few days when she was not beaten by him. The miserable childhood made her who she was, cold and inapproachable.\nBy the time the zombie virus broke out, Rebecca was only 5 years old. Too young to survive alone, she had to seek a shelter with her stepfather. After years of turmoil, she came across a crucial opportunity. In an unexpected siege by zombies, she was found and rescued by the Minutemen led by Benson. They brought her back to the "castle", a place where humans dwelt. To her amazement, her stepfather did something unusual at the critical moment -- he created an opportunity for the Minutemen to save Rebecca at the price of his own life. And so, he devoted the last few minutes of his life to the salvation of her daughter.\nAfter arriving at the "castle", Rebecca learnt how to shoot with the help of Benson. Her talent in shooting was rare but visible. That's why she was soon accepted as a member of the Minutemen. In a few years' time, Rebecca made it to become an outstanding sniper. With numerous contribution she made, she was promoted to Major at a young age. Impressed by her unparalleled skills and mysterious personality, everyone around her treated her with respect and admiration.\nOn the very day the "castle" fell, Rebecca was outside, leading her team on a mission. By the time she came back, the "castle" was already gone. Left with no other choice, Rebecca led the team to shift from one shelter to another, while searching for other people who got out of the "castle."</div><div class="diff-line add">251001=[Profile]\nFaction: To be unveiled\nProfession: To be unveiled\nSex: To be unveiled\nAge: To be unveiled\nHeight: To be unveiled\nWeight: To be unveiled\nNationality: To be unveiled\nBlood Type: To be unveiled\nBirthday: To be unveiled\n[Experience]\nTo be unveiled</div><div class="diff-line add">251002=Profile\nFaction: Solari\nProfession: Geologist\nSex: F\nAge: 36\nHeight: 165 cm\nWeight: 54 kg\nNationality: American\nBlood Type: A\nBirthday: June 20\nExperience\nBorn in Los Angeles, in a family of intellectuals, both her parents were geology professors in a well-known university. With their guidance and help, Diana began her journey in geology from an early age. When she was 16, the zombie crisis broke out. Luckily, Diana's family was under special protection from the government. After the government collapsed, they were escorted by the army to the dwelling of humans, the "castle." In the first few years, her parents were not treated well, for geology was considered useless in the doomsday and the management there was completely a mess. Forced to do all sorts of manual labor to make ends meet, they both died of illness within a few years.\nAfter that, as the resources were running low, the management finally realized that they had to expand their living space and began to look for experts in geology. That's when Diana was chosen as a geology consultant, responsible for the survey of underground resources and the excavation plan. With outstanding talent and years of study, Diana got her work done well with ease, earning a good salary with excellent performance. Later, she gained more respect and played an indispensable role there.\nHalf a month before the fall of the "castle", Diana was commissioned by the leader of the Minutemen, Benson, to help him study an ore of unknown origin. Before the results of the research could be obtained, the "castle" fell under the onslaught of the zombie wave. Diana escaped under the protection of the Minutemen. On the way out, she hid the ore in an office of EdenCorp she passed by to lessen the burden. In the end, she managed to get rid of the zombies, but somehow lost contact with the soldiers protecting her all the way.</div><div class="diff-line add">251003=Profile\nFaction: Solari\nProfession: Courier\nSex: M\nAge: 22\nHeight: 170 cm\nWeight: 67 kg\nNationality: American\nBlood Type: B\nBirthday: April 14\nExperience\nJack was born in an ordinary family in Indiana. When he was 2, the zombie crisis broke out. Both his parents were killed in the disaster. Jack was rescued by his uncle, Benson, leader of the Minutemen. He was then brought to the dwelling of humans, the "castle", where he was raised and cared for years. There, Jack received rigorous military training and got to know several members of the Minutemen. When he grew up, however, he chose to be a courier instead of following his uncle's arrangement to join the Minutemen.\nBefore the fall of "castle", Jack was accidentally involved in an issue, and nearly lost his life in it. It all started from the confidential intel stolen by Major Bolton of the Minutemen from EdenCorp. To keep it safe, he gave the intel to Jack without much explanation, and asked him to pass it to Benson. Not knowing how important the file was, Jack accidentally mixed the intel with other parcels. He thus became the target hunted by EdenCorp. With the skills and nimble mind he had developed during his years with the Minutemen, Jack made it to get back from the death's door several times. Unfortunately, the zombie wave broke through the defense of the Minutemen. And so the "castle" fell. Jack was not able to find Benson amid the chaos. Instead, he went all the way to the west with other survivors.

He had a failed marriage. His wife left him and took away his only daughter. Devastated and disheartened, Harrison has since devoted all his energy to his business and stayed single till now.\nIn 1992, the zombie crisis broke out. The 35 year old Harrison was driving to the city his ex-wife was in to deliver goods. At that time, a horde of zombies were flooding into the city. To protect his daughter, he drove to his ex-wife's house, only to find she and her current husband had already turned into zombies. He had no choice but to shoot them dead. The bad news was his daughter was missing. To find his daughter, Harrison made up his mind and rushed out onto the street. He found nothing and was unluckily caught in the middle of a horde of zombies. The moment he thought he was so dead, an army arrived in time and saved him. He followed the army all the way to the dwelling of humans, the "castle." Until then, he still could not find his daughter.\nTo search for his daughter, Harrison volunteered to join the Minutemen. Due to the irreversible damage caused by his previous injury, he failed to pass the physical test. In the end, he had to take up his old job -- farming. Later, he became a major supplier, and established partnership with the top business there -- EdenCorp. Harrison did not give up the hope to find his daughter. He told the Minutemen the basic info about his daughter and asked them for help when they went out on rescue missions. Although he knew there was little hope, he never gave up. Every now and then, he would go to the headquarters of the Minutemen to ask if there was any news about her.\nHis action, however, was misinterpreted by EdenCorp. Due to an info theft incident recently, it began a screening of partners. Harrison, as a supplier to the company, was listed as a major suspect for having private connections with the Minutemen. The poor Harrison was not aware of it at all. When the "castle" fell, Harrison escaped amid the chaos and hid in a warehouse. He found some communications equipment in there. Without hesitation, he contacted EdenCorp and decided to ask them for help...</div><div class="diff-line add">251005=Profile\nFaction: Solari\nProfession: Gardener\nSex: F\nAge: 38\nHeight: 165 cm\nWeight: 47 kg\nNationality: French\nBlood Type: AB\nBirthday: June 28\nExperience\nLafite was born in a well-known family of pharmacists in France. Under the influence of her family, she became a famous pharmacist at a young age. At the wake of the zombie crisis, the governments of all countries were trying to find a miracle cure to the zombie virus. As an expert in medicine, Lafite was invited by the government to do relevant researches. As a result, among many experts, she was the only one who developed the medicine to slow down the transformation process of the infected. Because of the great achievement, the government rewarded her and gave her special protection. After the government collapsed, a special force that protected her escorted her to the dwelling of humans, the "castle."\nLater, most people were convinced that there's no cure to the zombie virus. Lafite also gave up her research and began growing herbs, to heal the residents and cope with the drug shortage issue. She reaped a lot of wealth from the business and gained popularity among residents. Even the top business EdenCorp approached her, offering her a high price to develop a new drug. Lafite agreed instantly and began working on it soon.\nDuring this period, however, she found that the material provided by EdenCorp contained a special element, which was extremely similar to the zombie virus she once studied. She was taken aback by the finding. She then realized she was in a big trouble. After thinking it over, she decided not to tell anyone about the issue. Yet, she tried to delay the development of the drug. Every time she handled the results to EdenCorp, she would claim the research was still ongoing. She thought this would keep EdenCorp from taking notice. Just then, a wave of zombies overwhelmed the "castle" overnight.

From a young age, his dream was to become a movie star and he made his way to the US at the age of 20 to realize his dream in Hollywood. However, without the support of his family, he quickly found himself to be completely broke and had no choice but to work as a plumber to get by. This did not stop him as he continued to look for opportunities at the filming studios during his free time. Though he was unsuccessful in gaining the favor of any directors, he was still able to land roles as a background artist on several occasions.\nA few years later, the first zombie viruses struck. People haven't realized the severity of it due to it being in the preliminary stages. The media, on the other hand, made a big deal out of it and as a result, zombie movies became a popular genre. Mario landed a role in one of the zombie movies as the leader of a team of survivors. Unfortunately, on the day of the shoot, someone really did turn into a zombie at the studio and the filming venue fell into chaos almost immediately. Mario was lucky and made it out safely, he arrived at the streets outside to find more and more zombies and masses of people running for their lives. In the midst of chaos, he joins a team of survivors and miraculously continued to "play" his role as the leader of the team. He displayed astounding reasoning and reliability which earned the respect of the others and became a recognized leader. Under Mario's leadership, they first secured a number of firearms in the nearby police station, then they proceeded to the supermarket to scavenge for food and essential supplies. After the critical items have been secured, they began an escape on foot that went on for several months. Their journey was filled with danger and members continued to fall. They faced numerous dire situations, but Mario still managed to lead the team through the challenges and successfully reached "Castle," a human society. Only then, did Mario free himself of his "role" and discard his courage and confidence as he behaved like a complete coward at the praise and invitation of the society executives and the Minuteman.\nAfterwards, Mario continued his old trade of being a plumber and hid away his dream of becoming a movie star in the face of the arrival of the apocalypse. It remained the same way as many years passed by, until one day, as Mario was fixing the sewage pipes for Eden Corp., the largest corporation in the community, he heard a loud bang from the outside. The familiar sound of zombies roaring and people screaming filled his ears. He peeked through the crack in the pipes to see the one scene he never wished to see again. After twenty years of safety and peace, the society of the living was finally overrun by the zombies! However, this time Mario no longer possesses the courage nor the script to face the zombies once again and all he could do was to curl up helplessly in the darkness of the dark sewers...</div><div class="diff-line add">251007=[Profile]\nFaction: Solari\nProfession: Breeder\nSex: F\nAge: 25\nHeight: 170 cm\nWeight: 53 kg\nNationality: Canadian\nBlood Type: B\nBirthday: April 20\n[Experience]\nBorn in Montreal, Canada, to a family of researchers. At the age of 5, her parents were hired by the top financial group Eden Corp. and their entire family moved to the United States. Just as they arrived, the zombie havoc exploded before they could make it out of the airport. Elena's parents both sacrificed themselves to protect her and she was rescued by an airport security personnel named Coleman. After a few twists and turns of events, she found herself in "Castle," society of the living, and grew up under Coleman's care.\nGrowing up, Elena displayed a strong interest and talent towards breeding animals. She found a job being a breeder and became a professional breeder without any guidance. Eden Corp. was interested in her ability and extended numerous invitations to Elena. Unfortunately, these invitations were all rejected because seeing Eden Corp. reminds Elena of their tragic deaths.\nHowever, this did not mean the end to Eden Corp's efforts. They secretly sent agents to kidnap Elena and shipped her out of the society of the living and locked her up in one of their facilities in the outside world. They forced Elena to work for them, there was no way for her to retaliate so she had no choice but to comply, but little did she know, what they wanted her to breed were no ordinary animals, they were zombies locked up in a laboratory! Elena was shocked, but there were no other options. All she could do was to overcome her fear and the grotesque zombies to continue with her work.\nThe hellish life continued for an unknown period of time before Elena woke up from a nightmare one day to find a paper note next to her. The note included a detailed escape route and the guard shift rotation schedules, there was also a key next to the note. Though the origins of these two items are unknown, Elena's had enough of the life here and decided to give it a shot, because this might be the only chance she'll ever get.</div><div class="diff-line add">251008=[Profile]\nFaction: Solari\nProfession: Biologist\nSex: F\nAge: 27\nHeight: 165 cm\nWeight: 51 kg\nNationality: American \nBlood Type: A\nBirthday: January 5\n[Experience]\nAn orphan from Nevada who was taken in by the orphanage immediately after birth. The zombie virus spread when she was only 7 years old. Following the instructions of the orphanage staff, Bonnie and her companions attempt to escape the chaos. However, people continued to die or turn during their escape and Bonnie was the only one who survived in the end. Luckily, in the face of despair, Bonnie encountered biologist Dr. Helen. With Helen's expertise in biology and her specialization in researching the zombie virus, they received special treatment in the society of the living—a rescue team of twenty fully-armed personnel was sent to escort the two to "Castle," the society of the living and their post-apocalyptic life turns to a new chapter.\nAfter settling in in "Castle," Bonnie was adopted by Helen and began her learning of biology. After growing up, Bonnie received a job offer from Eden Corp. with her outstanding scores and became an employee of the largest corporation in the living society. Bonnie had it all, everything was nothing but smooth sails in the first few years, but she slowly began to notice that there was more to the corporation than what's on the surface. The deeper she became involved with Eden Corp., the more she suspected them of hiding some kind of large secret. Just as her suspicions continued, Coleman, a member of the Minuteman, the largest military force in the society of the living, and the rescue team captain that led the team who escorted Bonnie and Helen to the society of the living had found her to ask her to assist in investigating Eden Corp. Due to the relationship the two continued after the rescue, Coleman kept no secrets and told Bonnie that the Volunteer Army suspects that Eden Corp. has something to do with the zombie catastrophe and that they're continuing some kind of extremely classified operation in secret. Everything Coleman said matched Bonnie's suspicion of Eden Corp., so she agreed to help him and became a spy of the Minuteman in Eden Corp.</div><div class="diff-line add">251009=[Profile]\nFaction: Solari\nProfession: Butler\nSex: Female\nAge: 61\nHeight: 165cm\nWeight: 53kg\nNationality: Netherlands\nBlood type: B\nBirthday: August 20\n[Experience]\nCara, who was born into a famous family, took a path that was completely opposite to what she had expected simply because of the presence of zombies.

On the day of her 16th birthday, Chihiro waited passionately till the sunset for her parents' return, only to receive news of their death by zombies. Soon after, the once genial kinfolks showed their true colors. Chihiro and his brother barely made it to the underground Fortress among all the power-grabbing inside the family who sent deadly pursuit on them. Chihiro lost her warming smile ever since. The cheerful little girl was no longer there. So cold and indifferent she became, she no longer put faith in other people.\nLife in the Fortress was not easy for a girl with no other support. Her brother Ogawa was the only reason she pulled through, the only person who gave her strength and courage. He taught Chihiro the art of swords and lifted her to become one of the best swordstresses. The sword Murasame left by her mother granted her the resolution to kill and for revenge, though the latter defines her more cruel swordsmanship over the years.\nFor that matter, arguments broke out several times between the siblings.

We are just a bunch of slackers who need to rest and be fed. At least, that's what the foreman calls us. "I'll replace you useless shit with Machines, sooner or later!" he shouted, as usual, but I knew he wouldn't do so, for a cheapskate like him paying us with leftovers won't spend an extra coin on expensive machines. \n"This is all we do! Checking and repairing! I can't tell if I'm alive or working in this stupid power plant called hell!" I vented my anger on the machine next to me. \n"Stop complaining, Fernando.

The foreman unctuously stood next to her, livid at us as usual. \n"I just hope she is not here to finish what the foreman started... Though... she's kinda...pretty." As the expert approached, I saw her face more clearly. That gorgeous face rooted me to the spot where I stood, and I could hear my heart beating.

To her, the pain inflicted on her body was nothing compared to her dying stomach. That's how Natalie survived the last seven years. Without the strength and skills of an adult, she could only resort to stealing food while enduring all the curses and beatings. \n"Stop it, Bacchus!" An unfamiliar voice broke out, interrupting the abusive routine for the first time. \n"Prof... Professor Gallo." Noticing it was from the community's prominent Professor Gallo, Bacchus immediately put on his other face and explained, "I'm the victim here. This is the third time this month! It's not like I'm running a charity! Surely you understand how hard to make a living these days, Professor Gallo." \nIt was barely convincing for the mining magnate, who constantly deprived workers of food and delayed their payments, to complain about hardship at the time. Everyone in the community knows Bacchus has the Vindicators backing him for his wrongdoing. Professor Gallo kept quiet and signed to his wife to pick Natalie up. \n"Little girl, what is your name? Where are your parents?" asked Mrs. Gallo while wiping the dust from Natalie's face with a handkerchief. That's when Bacchus realized the little brat he called was actually a girl. \n"......" \n"Madame, this child must be mute. I never heard her utter a word." \nPreoccupied with her hard-won food, Natalie engulfed the bread as they talked. When she regained her strength to clear the blurry images in her eyes, she realized Mrs. Gallo was still there, squatting next to her, tenderly smiling at her. Feeling encouraged, Natalie stuttered out the name she had never been called, the one she had learned from the main character in a tattered book. \n"Natalie... has no parents." \n"Well, would you let us be your parents, then?" Catching the faltering look on Natalie's face, Mrs. Gallo softened her voice, "We can't have children of our own, and I've always wanted to adopt a strong girl like you. Natalie, are you willing to be our daughter? We'll try our best to give you a lovely home." \nNatalie was dumbfounded, as if she was digesting the meaning of the words she had just heard, when Bacchus got impatient and gave her a push, "Are you seriously considering this?! Professor Gallo will be the one developing a vaccine. Do you know how many people are begging to stay by his side? Being adopted by them is a shortcut to happily ever after!" \nA seven-year-old Natalie had no idea what happily ever after meant, much less a vaccine. However, the word "home" appealed to her.

Freedom?!"\nEvery time Emma tried to go out, her father would describe the horrors of surviving alone in the doomsday. Emma knew very well the risk, yet it was still not a good enough reason for her to come to terms with being imprisoned for the rest of her life, so that time, she gave her father a picture of her mother smiling happily on the job.\n"When mother was on the most dangerous front line doing her job, did you consider she reckless and stupid?"\n"I don't think so. You were always proud of her, saying she was doing honest and righteous work."\n"...I wish I had done things differently." As if suddenly deflated, Emma's father bent his sturdy back while his eyes turned red from anger or maybe sadness. After a long while, he uttered a muffled voice.\n"Had she not pursued this dangerous job, our family would have lived happily in the community. And now, she's gone missing, and everyone knows what that means. I won't let you follow in your mother's footsteps!"\n"The world deserves to know the truth! If anyone can finish what mother started, it's me!" Unlike her father, who accepted the death of his wife, Emma believed that her mother was still alive and waiting for her. She assured her father.\n"Father, I'll return with news of mother. I promise you."</div><div class="diff-line add">251024=Hero Biography</div><div class="diff-line add">251025=[Profile]\nFaction: Solari\nProfession: Miner\nSex: M\nAge: 32\nHeight: 180cm\nWeight: 72kg\nNationality: American\nBlood Type: B\nDate of birth: February 17\n[Experience]\nGrowing up in the countryside, Lemuros spoke his local dialect with a weird accent.

Unfortunately, the first boss he met was Bacchus, who was extremely stingy. Bacchus sent him to work in mines, telling him this was a good job everyone wanted with all the living expenses covered. The fact was Lemuros received the lowest pay after completing the largest amount of work. One day, Lemuros was dispatched to help geologist Diana with her mineral investigation.

He was weak and timid. He had to work around the clock to make ends meet. Despite the tough life, he still had a strong passion for life. Although he could only earn half a loaf of bread with half a day's work, he would still share it with those homeless children he ran into on a stormy midnight. \nIn the chaotic apocalyptic age, compassion did not worth a penny. Timid Matthew soon became the one bullied by others. He was often punched and kicked, and even robbed by those bullies. The pain all over his body made Matthew realize that no other people would help the ones suffering from poverty and hunger as he did. \n"Fight or get bullied." \nThe next time the punks tried to cut his hair in a gutter, Matthew clenched his fists. \n"The more I appear to be afraid of them, the more troubles they'll provoke." \nHe gritted his teeth when the money he earned with a day's work was taken away by the punks brandishing wolfsbane. \n"Good men were bullied yet the villains were not punished." \nThe day his supplies were taken away by a child he once helped on that stormy night, Matthew finally gave up all his innocent hopes. \nHe then decided to join the Vindicators. He changed into a fancy haircut and painted a terrifying mask on his face with colored paint. He even began to bully the weak. When he hit an enemy with his crowbar, saw his splashing blood, and heard his screaming, Matthew felt that a part of him was gone. \nYet Matthew was happy to see the loot he got. He ran away while laughing despite the pursuit of the vigilantes behind him. That day, he also ran away from his past when he was somewhat timid but was willing to share food with the children.</div><div class="diff-line add">251029="Sir! The number of zombies in the northwest of our community exceeded the alarm level! We are all at your order." \nOn receiving the report from the soldier, McKinley was leaning back in his chair with his legs crossed, checking the warrant officer's badge he had just received. In contrast to the anxiety of the soldier, he shook off the cigarette ash and then rose to his feet slowly: \n"I see. Just a couple of zombies, right? No need to worry." \n"But the radar indicated that the zombies are closing in faster than usual. Do we need to ask for some reinforcement, Sir?" The soldier suggested hesitantly. \nWith his multiple victories and recent promotion in rank, McKinley was quite confident about his judgment. He interrupted the soldier's report and gave his order:\n"The zombies must be attracted by someone who went out to search for resources without permission! I received such reports every single month! Stop worrying over such trivial things. Be a real soldier, okay? I'll get rid of a bunch of those brainless things with one shot! Now tell our men to gather in ten minutes. We'll finish off this zombie horde." \n"Yes, Sir!" \nThe troops soon assembled in front of the gate of the community in a well-organized way. McKinley boasted his merits and victories again in front of the residents, and promised that he would bring all the soldiers back after this victory. As the soldiers arrived at the site, however, they were all stunned by the colossal being they saw. There was a Mutated Zombie which was several meters tall and had blackish and purplish skin. They started to shoot at the zombie, yet the bullets did not slow down its movement, but made it turn violent. It roared while dashing towards the soldiers. The neat defensive formation was instantly destroyed. \nMcKinley who had disdained to take the advice of the soldier now knew he made a fatal mistake. And the price was the death of the fellow soldiers who fought alongside him for years. He shouted at the troops, ordering everyone to retreat. But sadly, he could not change a thing. \n"Sir, run!" \nThe last soldier used his body to shield McKinley from a zombie and push him into the vehicle. He dared not look at the corpses for one more second. And so the young warrant officer became a shameful deserter he once hated the most.</div><div class="diff-line add">251030=Due to Brom's perilous career as a mercenary, his wife had to lead an unsettled life with him for years. With the birth of their daughter, however, Brom finally decided to "retire." The only thing he couldn't let go of was the group of lads he trained in his mercenary team. Meanwhile, these energetic young men were eager to show Brom what they could do to impress him.\n"Boss, let us do this escort mission alone this time! Your wife just gave birth; you do need to stay here to take care of her," said one of the young mercenaries, while stroking the pinky face of the baby in Brom's arm. Judging from his resolute tone, the young man was quite confident about their ability.\n"By the way, the little princess is almost three months old! Haven't you decided her name yet, boss? We can't keep calling her 'baby girl' all the time, right?"\n"None of your business, okay? Her name was already decided," Brom replied. Worried that the baby would be aroused by the young man, Brom pushed him aside and placed the sleeping baby back in the crib in a clumsy yet gentle manner. Then, he grabbed the young man by the ear and dragged him out of the room before raising his voice, \n"Do the escort mission alone? You think it's an easy thing, don't ya? Let me tell you, the stuff is going to Vindicators' base. The least predictable lunatics in the wasteland! If you guys can really complete the mission without my help, maybe I'll consider handing the mercenary team to you."\nUpon hearing Brom's words, the young man, who was joking around moments ago, suddenly put on a serious look. He saluted Brom in a not-so-standard gesture and answered firmly, \n"Copy that. We'll make sure the mission is completed well!"\nIn fact, these carefree young men grew faster than Brom had expected. On the day of the mission, they easily infiltrated the Vindicators' base in disguise and handed the stuff to their contact. The mission was accomplished perfectly, after which Brom and the young men came back together. Looking at the lads chatting happily and mocking each other for the flaws in their disguise, Brom had a rare smile of relief on his face. He was now assured that it was time to start his leisure life with his wife and daughter, and these young men...would definitely create a better future for fellow mercenaries.\nWhat Brom did not expect, however, was the horrible scene he saw when they got closer to their base. Rows of houses fell down, with many objects burnt. Brom suddenly realized the seemingly simple escort mission was a trap to lure them away. He immediately rushed into the house, only to find his wife lying in a pool of blood, clinging tightly to the key to the secret room. To prevent the enemies from knowing the existence of the secret room, she left her daughter in the secret room alone and went out to distract the enemies.\n"Our dau-daughter...is in the...secret room... Go! Find her...and...leave the place..." With her last ounce of strength, his wife handed him the key, "Promise me...keep Doris safe..."\nDoris, the name that they decided to unveil after they settled in their new home, now became her last words.\nBrom could barely contain his rage right now. In his eyes was the determination to slay the enemy. To protect his little girl from being retaliated, Brom quickly came up with a plan - the Minutemen. The next day, he left her daughter on the road that the Minutemen would pass by every day. He then hid himself in a bush and waited until he saw Captain Bolton who was shocked to see the baby pick her up. He knew the Minutemen would be a better protector for Doris. He then swore to seek the enemies that killed his wife and complete the revenge with the rest of his life.\n"I'm not a good husband; nor am I a good father. But I swear I'll make sure Doris grows up safe and sound."</div><div class="diff-line add">251031="Get lost, you stinking thing!" the owner shoved Barron out of the restaurant. Pointing at the rice crumbs on Barron's lips, the owner shouted at him, "Can't you stop eating for five minutes? You haven't done a thing I told you to do. Do you think I'm kind enough to offer free lunches to lazy bones? Be gone, idiot!"\n"Sorry... but I did my work..." Faced with the owner's insults, Barron did not show a slight trace of anger. Rubbing his round belly, he replied hesitantly in a low voice, "I was just hungry... I promise I'll start working right after filling up my stomach!"\n"Hungry? You ate an entire barrel of food! That's the ration of three days for a normal man! You've said "hungry" dozens of times today. I don't want to hear the word anymore, you freak!" The owner tossed the empty food container in front of Barron furiously. Initially, he thought Barron was but a dumb guy with great force. He never expected how big a stomach Barron got. He threw Barron's luggage out and slammed the door.\n"But...Ouch!" Barron, who wasn't quite articulate, failed to convince the owner and was hit by the door in the face. Once again, he was "dumped" by another boss. He roamed on the street and somehow walked into a filthy alley. He almost stumbled upon a box as he could barely "watch" his footsteps because of his round belly. Not long after, his stomach began to rumble loudly.\n"My stomach... Barron is hungry..." \nWhile muttering to himself, Barron's noticed the leftover food in a dumpster ahead. It was a mix of food scraps that had been there for who knows how many days. The awful rotten smell could not even turn on the appetite of rats. But Barron didn't care about it. The painful memory of hunger and nausea made eating an instinctive reflex for him. As long as it could alleviate his hunger, Barron would eat anything. And so, he approached the dumpster and stuffed everything he could grab into his mouth, without trying to tell what exactly he was eating.\n"Oh, my goodness! What is he eating?" A passerby exclaimed in fear. Barron paused for a second and turned his head toward the man, with a mouthful of flesh in his mouth. The next second, the man screamed, "That...that's a human arm, geez!! The freak is eating human flesh! Help! Help!! I saw a cannibal!"\n"No, Barron is just having a meal," Barron tried to explain, but the remains on his lips explained everything. In a community where the humane side did not perish yet, eating the flesh of one's own kind was no doubt a red flag. Driven away by the guards, Barron had to leave the community.\n"Why did they ask Barron to leave? Barron didn't do anything wrong. Barron was just hungry." Unable to tell the difference between human and animal flesh, Barron couldn't understand why they treated him that way.\nDue to unbearable hunger, he kept walking in the hope of finding another dumpster. Soon, the bodies surrounded by a few zombies drew his attention. On seeing his "food", Barron knocked down the zombies with his bare fists in a minute. Just as he was about to enjoy his "feast," a mysterious man came to him and passed him a loaf of bread that Barron hadn't seen in years.\n"Are you saying I can get food as long as I do as you say and kill someone?" Barron thought about the "deal" for a couple of seconds and nodded, "Sure, as long as I get food to eat, I'll help you take revenge."</div><div class="diff-line add">251032=One day, Kin Ogawa, who was looking for ores to enhance his sword, arrived at a refugee shelter. The refugees, dressed in rags, huddled in small groups next to damaged walls. They were also holding their breath, because several zombies were pacing around not far away. \nBy the time Kin arrived, these survivors had run out of food and were on the verge of starvation. Despite the tough situation, none of them dared to break out and seek help. The group of zombies in the distance were of a smaller size in number. Still, they chose to stay in the ruins rather than fight for a way out. Cowardice was their biggest enemy. As most of them were about to starve to death, Kin, who came here to look for ores, gave them a gleam of hope. \n"Look! Someone's here! He's one of the Wildlings. Save us, sir!" The group of people who were lying in the corner "miraculously" gained strength and crawled to Kin. They dragged Kin's trousers, begging him to take them away. \n"The nearest human community is right there in the east. Only three kilometers away." Kin stepped back and shook off the "welcoming" hands. He then put back his tilted hat and raised one hand, showing them the direction of the community. \n"We know where the community is. But you see there are so many zombies ahead. As a member of the Wildlings, it's reasonable for you to escort us there, isn't it?" Said one refugee, with many more nodding at him to show approval. \n"Exactly. The Wildlings shouldn't be so ruthless." \n"It's your duty to help the weak like us!" \n</div><div class="diff-line add">"......" Kin was caught speechless by the rude "request." He looked at this group of people who waited for others to "help" them, who reminded him of the zombies who lost their dignity with nothing left but a human-like appearance. \nWith a clinging sound, he pulled out his sword to warn the refugees. Finally, they stopped dragging him.\n"Sorry. I'm afraid I can't help you." Kin said as he threw a short knife on the ground: "Grab the weapon and protect yourself, guys. With arms and legs, you are not in need of any help from Wildlings." \n"I'm heading to the human community right now and will get rid of the zombies on the way. Those who want to leave, take the weapon and follow me; those who want to live with the fear of the so-called "danger", stay here and wait for the miracle to happen." \nAfter finishing his words, Kin turned around and left. The refugees began to protest behind him in a loud voice, "accusing" Kin of his ruthless attitude. When they realized that Kin was not waiting for them, they panicked. \n"Heh, gentleman. Please, please wait... Uhh... Be gone, disgusting zombies!" They then stood up and picked up the knife, running towards Kin as fast as they could. It turned out that fighting a zombie head-on was much more terrifying than running away from them. But when a man finally held the knife and aimed at the zombies, something inside him seemed to have changed out of a sudden. \n"Wait. I want to thank you for your words." The man who slayed a zombie on his own for the first time ran to Kin. \n"What do you mean? I didn't do anything." \n"No, you made me realize that it's always better to save myself than wait for someone else to save me."</div><div class="diff-line add">251033=Harman was born in the Tribe of Sand, one of the most powerful tribes in the wasteland. People there were all remarkable weapon makers who could craft weapons that could be used to either fight off invaders or protect their fellow residents. The chief of the Tribe of Sand was in an old age. That's why on the day of the annual celebration, he announced the rules for the election of the next chief. The candidates needed to hunt down the mutated zombies outside the tribe and Harman was one of the candidates. \nDue to his dull and overly righteous personality, he did not have the support of many people. Harman did not care much about what others thought as a matter of fact. He went out alone for the zombie hunt. By the time he saw a mutated zombie following the trail left by it, someone was already fighting it alone. In the face of a zombie twice as tall as a human, even a strong warrior would be dwarfed. The weapon in his hand appeared to be a children's toy, which could barely leave a scratch on the thick skin of the zombie. \nAt this moment, the zombie was trying to throw the warrior into the air with its long arm; its sharp claws were about to tear the warrior's chest apart. Harman wasted no time and threw his weapon at the zombie to stop it. \n"Thank goodness... I'm still alive!" exclaimed the warrior. "Thank you so much, uhh...Mr...?" \n"Call me Harman." \n"Oh, Harman! I don't know how to thank you! If it weren't for you, I would have died ten seconds ago." The warrior was obviously embarrassed by the fact that he didn't even know the name of his savior. He then tried to start another topic: "I never expected someone would stand out and save me in the middle of such a vital competition. The candidates were all fighting for themselves and wished that more competitors could be "eliminated" here." \nOn hearing the statement, Harman showed a shocked face. He could not understand why a warrior would refuse to save his fellow warriors from the same tribe. He answered in a sincere tone: "Lives always come before the competition." \nThis was also what the chief often said. It was the first time someone mentioned it in a decisive competition. The young warrior was dumbfounded. He forced out a smile and proposed tentatively: "Well...then why don't we work together to get rid of the big fella first?" \n"Sure." \nHarman held up his weapon and headed toward the giant zombie. Under Harman's cover, the young warrior was able to get closer to the zombie and launched a few deadly cannonballs. Together, they managed to blow the head off the zombie. \n"Good job, dude! You know what? This is the first time I got a partner in the zombie hunt! And...it feels great!! But who should get the credit for this zombie?" \n"Half for you 'n half for me, I guess. Alright, time to look for the next prey." \n"Okay, fair enough. Let's see who could hunt more zombies in the end." The two competitors headed in opposite directions after a quick fist bump.</div><div class="diff-line add">251034=Born into a family of soldiers, Bolton was a scrupulous and upright man. He had been fighting on the front line for years, turning from a rookie into a general. He gained outstanding merit in battles. In the wake of the zombie crisis, however, Bolton's once-promising career path met the Waterloo. The numb zombies that did not know what pain was kept spreading a contagious virus. Cities fell one after another. Bolton's army had to retreat all the way to a suburban town, where they tried their best to safeguard the remaining survivors.\nDays later, they managed to drive away the zombie horde. As everyone was celebrating the hard-won victory, Bolton received an urgent report from the front line, saying that an even larger zombie horde, composed of over a thousand zombies, was heading towards the town. They were estimated to arrive by the night of the next day. In the previous battle, Bolton's army had suffered heavy casualties fighting against hundreds of zombies. Now they had to face an enemy ten times the size of the previous one. This was undoubtedly devastating for a small town with about a hundred guards only. Even Bolton, who had fought and won many battles could not come up with a feasible tactic. At the critical moment, He received a letter from his father. The former commander-in-chief presented him with another option. \n"Bolton, the zombie horde will arrive at the city of X tonight. Leave the place now with the escorting army." \n"Leave? Are you asking me to be a deserter?!" Out there were the people whose lives were in danger. If a soldier like him chose to run away, how could others have faith to live on? He would rather die among the zombies than act as a deserter. \nHe tore up the letter in rage and turned around to go back to his command room. Two soldiers who were supposed to escort Bolton in the retreat stood before him. \n"What do you think you are doin'? Disobey my order? Get out of my way!" \n"Sorry, sir. We cannot disobey the commander-in-chief either. Please come with us." \n"Fine. You either let me stay here, or kill me now."\n"Sir, please come with us. You've already done too much. You've been staying here protecting those useless survivors for three months. In such an apocalypse, the old social order has long gone. No one will blame you for leaving at such a time."\nAnother soldier nodded, "Yes, many armies were disbanded these days. It's hard to stay alive, let alone take care of others."\nMore soldiers who had already decided to retreat began to persuade Bolton to leave. If they left now, at least they could stay alive. They stood little chance of beating the zombie horde even if they stayed there any longer.\n"If we disband like others do, there will be not a single army left." Regardless of the persuasion, Bolton made up his mind and came up with an idea, a bold but resolute one: "If the old order perished in the apocalyptic age, I'll create a new one then. We need at least one organization where people can protect each other with one mind!" \n"Yes! I'll create an organization with the power of solidarity!" said young Bolton in a resolute voice. Little did he know that it was this idea that led to the creation of a powerful organization that completely changed the political landscape of the apocalyptic world.</div><div class="diff-line add">251035="Enrique, what are you doing? Lucky is dead! Just let me bury her." \nNatalie ran over to stop Enrique, who was holding a knife and trying to do something to the poor puppy named Lucky. Enrique did not stop what he was doing at all. He continued to point the knife at different parts of the dog's abdomen as if looking for a proper spot for dissection. A few seconds later, he replied slowly and nonchalantly: \n"As you said, it's a dead dog, so I can do anything I want to it. Don't you want to know what it's like inside a dog that hasn't turned into a zombie dog? Think about this. If I can learn something useful from the dissection, the dog is making a contribution to scientific research in a way." \n"Stop it. You're not Dr. Gallo. You don't know a thing about biology!" \n"Right. That's why I need to practice." \n"Lucky died when she tried to protect my father's lab from zombies. You can't treat her like what you did to those useless rubbish." \n"But it's dead already, isn't it? Once it's dead, it's useless." \nEnrique, who was only in his teens, showed his cold and ruthless nature that was more terrifying than what you could see from an adult. In his eyes, things were either "useful" or "useless." Emotions were not worth a thing to him. Looking at Enrique's emotionless eyes for a few seconds, little Natalie gave up. She ran away to ask for help from his father, Dr. Gallo. Just as Enrique was about to continue his dissection, someone came over while giving him a round of applause. The stranger was in a cape with skull-shaped patterns on it. \n"Impressive! Well said, young man!" The man continued in his lunatic tone, "I've been looking for someone like you, someone who could think bold and act bold at such a young age! You are born to be one of the Vindicators!" \n"Vindicators...what do you mean?" \n"An organization made of only the strong. We do not convince a person with words, but fists." \n"An organization of the strong? Sounds interesting, this Vindicators group." \n"Looking forward to seeing you at our next meeting then." \nThe man handed young Enrique an invitation letter and went away. He knew he didn't need to say anything else. The child who could say something like "Once it's dead, it's useless" would definitely join the Vindicators one day, sooner or later.</div><div class="diff-line add">251036=Blanche was a bad student who had just dropped out of school. She also had another important identity, the lead singer of an underground band. Her powerful voice and impressive guitar play soon won her great fame. The band was also known by more people because of its passionate and addictive songs. The day the band held its first underground heavy metal concert, the apocalypse broke out unexpectedly. \n"Deathcore! Deathcore! Deathcore!" \nThe fans shouted out the name frantically to welcome the band onto the stage. After a short high-pitched sound, the spotlight shone upon the center of the stage, and Blanche stepped onto the stage, with a guitar in her hand. The audience burst into louder cheers. The crowd called Blanche's nickname over and over again.\n"Metalhead! Metalhead!" \n"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the deathcore party!! Tonight, we'll revive from death. Tonight, we'll bring you a new song that keeps your heart pounding! Now listen — the Roar of Death!" \nA good song was always the best way to show appreciation to the support from the fans. Blanche and her teammates nodded at each other. With the drummer dropped the first beat, a sensational melody started. People began to dance to the beat. As the song reached its climax, the cheers grew louder. No one noticed that, at this moment, someone opened his crimson eyes among the crowd, with his limbs twisted in a creepy way. He seemed to be saying something, but his voice was low and hoarse. \n"Heh, stay away from me! It's a place to listen to music, okay? Heh! What the heck! What are you doin'?" \nAs a lady raised her voice to warn the "stranger" standing way too close to her, another person turned around to see what happened. As he was trying to pat on the shoulder of the guy who "disturbed" others, he somehow paused midway, with his arm freezing in the air. The next second, he was bitten on his neck by the "weird" guy. The zombie virus began to spread rapidly against the deafening music. It was not until a zombie crawled onto the stage and tried to bite the drummer that Blanche realized what actually happened. The performance immediately paused; more audience noticed the "weirdly behaving" guys around them. In contrast to the deafening music just now, the entire hall was filled with screams and cries. \nThe guitar, which had gone through a special modification before the performance, now became an excellent weapon that came in handy. In order to help the audience get out of the hall, Blanche brandished her beloved guitar to clear a way for them. The metal guitar hit the heads of one zombie and another, making strange yet unique sounds. It sounded like the whisper of the Reaper, an overture to a new chapter of death.</div><div class="diff-line add">251037="Dad...how you doin' today?" \nLying on the bed with a pale face, Alice said in a light-hearted tone and forced out a smile at Roland who dropped by the hospital to see her, but her clenched fist and the sweat-soaked bed sheet "gave her out." Roland was heartbroken to see the scene. He walked to the bedside, extending his hand to warm the cold hand of Alice, and replied gently: \n"Alice, just a few more days to go. Dad's research will be soon completed. Then we'll replace your heart with a metal one, strong enough to help you grow healthily like everyone else. It's gonna be alright. Everything's gonna be alright...okay?" \nRoland, a shrewd and successful businessman, now was just a father somewhat panicked at his daughter's aggravating illness. He kept comforting her with repeated words, as if the more times he repeated, the more likely it would come true. A day ago, the doctor told them about the new treatment plan — a heart transplant, as Roland mentioned. Alice failed to hide the fear on her face this time, no matter how hard she tried. She was a seven-year-old child after all. The unsuccessful treatments previously were a torment to both her body and mind. She had enough of the agony all over her body. Compared to the tiny hope of recovery, the young girl was more afraid of the unknown pain. \n"Prosthetic surgery...will it hurt?" \n"No, Dad will never let any pain torture you again. I promise." \nRoland promised her in a soft yet resolute voice. He had been proceeding with the prosthetic experiment personally over the past years. He even volunteered to be the first one to receive the prosthetic transplant surgery to test its safety. He replaced his right arm, with which he first held his beloved daughter, with a prosthetic arm, hoping that the metallic arm could be strong enough to protect her daughter from any harm. But he never expected that, by the time he woke up in the ward, the doctor told him that his daughter failed to make it this morning and passed away. \n"NOOOO! That's not true! Alice is just sleeping...there...there must be a way to cure her...virus? zombie? Ahh!" \nRoland carefully placed his daughter in the sleep pod. Looking at Alice who he believed was "having a sound sleep", Roland was now taken over by madness: "Hold on, sweetheart! Dad will find a way to wake you up!"</div><div class="diff-line add">251038=Beesly was the most notorious name in the town. Who was he? A delinquent who did nothing else but pick up troubles, roam around, and sneak things from his neighbors as a way to collect the so-called "protection fee." He was the one that everyone hated in the town. The day the zombie crisis broke out, however, he somehow turned into another man.\n"Mommy, where are you? Daddy...Daddy is so scary right now! Help, Mom…"\n"Lily! Don't be afraid. Mommy's here. Now get out through that window! I'll help you stop Daddy."\nHer father, who turned into a zombie, now was getting closer to the room where she and her mother were hiding. The little girl dragged the arm of her mother who fell into a coma, trying to wake her up. Hearing her daughter's cry, the mother regained consciousness slowly, but she was not able to stand up given her legs that were hit in the fights against her "husband." The only thing she could do was to crawl all the way to the door and keep the door shut with her body, to earn Lily more time to run away. The saddening fact was, even if Lily made it to get out, how many days a little girl like her could survive alone in the apocalyptic times? The mother dared not think further. As she was overwhelmed by the devastating situation, the zombie outside the door stopped pounding on the door.\n"Now get lost! Out of my way! Who's there? The zombie was thrown out. Now come out. You're safe!”\nThe mother heard the loud and irritable voice of Beesly from behind the door, along with the sound of the zombie falling heavily to the ground. Not receiving any response from inside, Beesly began to knock on the door, more violently than the zombie did before. The appearance of the grumpy man gave the woman and her daughter a gleam of hope at the desperate moment.\n"Mommy! A hero has come to save us! Look, a real hero!"\n"Heh! Little girl. Stop callin' me a hero. I'll consider exempting your protection fee if you behave as a good kid." Beesly said so in a seemingly intimidating tone and laid his hand on the little girl’s shoulder, trying to stop her from getting closer. But the girl was not scared at all by the "hero" in her eyes.\n"Beesly… I never thought... Anyway, thank you so much." The mother wiped the tears from her face and looked at Beesly with gratitude. Beesly, who used to argue a lot with this neighbor, felt a bit guilty and uneasy thinking of what he had done before. He then waved his hand and put on an indifferent look:\n"Enough with the tears. You paid the protection fee, I did my job. Not a big deal." He extended his hand to help the woman stand up. The three then left the saddening place and headed to the fortress in the neighboring town. The scene on the streets was even worse. Countless bodies were on both sides of the road. To distract the little girl, Beesly started a conversation with her:\n"I can see you are very brave and got great force. I'll give you some real training when we get to the fortress. Then you can be as strong as me."\n"You mean I can be a heroine myself and protect my mom from zombies?"\n"Surely you will. It'll just take a few more years' time."</div><div class="diff-line add">251039="Pamela, how come you only got second place in the competition?"\n"Stop playing with them. Are you done with your training today? Do not leave the shooting range before you hit the target!"\n"Pamela, I'm so upset. I don't get it. How could my kid be so incompetent? Your father and I are both Olympic champions. How can you fail over and over again without making any progress?"\nEvery time Pamela stood in the shooting range, the criticisms from her parents would be repeated in her mind, making her more panicked and terrified every time she made a mistake. The shooting range used to be the place she loved the most. Now it was a hell full of nightmare. She stared at the human-shaped targets in the distance, as if she saw a bunch of monsters mocking how "incompetent" she was. Her trembling hands now made it impossible for her to pull the trigger.\n"If I can't hit the target, the whole thing is meaningless. Maybe what mom and dad are correct. I just don't have the talent for this."\nPamela thought to herself in despair. The idea made her become more silent. One day, she put her beloved pistol in the box, together with her shattered dream.\n"Hey, Pamela, isn't it the day of the youth shooting competition today? Why are you still here? I got a new cheerleading outfit. Good luck for our sharpshooter!" Little Lori knocked on the window pane and peered at the inside from the half-open window.\n"Go watch the competition yourself. Please leave me alone. I won't be able to get the first place anyway. Cheer for someone else then." Pamela said so in a gloomy mood.\n"Pamela! What's goin' on? You know I watch the competition not for the champion, but for my best friend, you!" Lori frowned and knocked on the window pane again.\n"Cheer up, my best friend and the best shooter!"\n"Forget about it. I can't be the champion anyway. That'll waste all your efforts." Pamela tried to shut the window, only to find Lori was no longer there.\n"Who cares about that title!" Lori's loud voice suddenly sounded from outside the door. She dashed into the room and took out the box from under the bed. Ignoring Pamela's refusal, Lori still handed the pistol to her and said: "I don't care who wins. What I want to see is my dear Pamela who can stay calm and poised in the competition and hit the target like nothing can stop her."\n"C'mon. Let's give it another go. I'll go with you."</div><div class="diff-line add">251040=In the early days of the apocalypse, humans freshly managed to rebuild their community. Every place was haunted by a gloomy and depressing air. A wave of zombie attacks just ended. Humans suffered heavy casualties again. More than half of the adults were killed or injured, leaving some elderly people or people with disabilities using as much force as they had to bandage the wounded and bury the dead. One could see little hope in the eyes of the people. The waves of zombie attacks took away so many lives. No one knew who would be the next. Everyone was living with a countdown over their heads; more and more people gave up on survival and began to wait calmly for the reaper to take them away.\n"Anyone there? I need some help!"\nLori, who had just escaped from a zombie siege, finally arrived at the human community after three days of walking, thanks to the clues left by other survivors. She shouted for help at the gate, but no one responded. The silence even made her believe the entire community had fallen. When she saw the clothes hanging on the other side of the wall and tire trails left recently, she knew there must be people living there. But why no one showed up yet or responded to her? Lori found the place a bit weird.\n"Go somewhere else." When Lori knocked on the gate half a minute later, the lifeless eyes of an old lady appeared from the crack of the gate.\nThe old lady opened the door slowly and told Lori what happened to the community. Behind the gate were all wounded soldiers and abandoned children. They could barely find a dozen soldiers who could still fight on the battlefield among all residents in the community. One zombie could easily kill the last batch of survivors here. Lori was not the first one who visited the community. Many came here before to seek help, but they all left after learning about the terrible situation here. The old lady did not expect that Lori would stay, so she waved at Lori and signaled Lori to leave if she wanted to find another shelter.\n"Leave? Why would I leave? We have so many survivors here! I finally have a place to stay!"\n"Did you listen to what I said? All the survivors here can't even fight off a single zombie. The community won't last long."\n"If we can't beat them, we may hide from them for the moment. There will always be a way to live on. Don't give up this easily, ma'am!" Lori's voice was like a ray of sunshine, lighting up the dull community and bringing people a gleam of hope.</div><div class="diff-line add">251041="Annie, I'll go collect some food. I'll be back before it's getting dark. Remember, do not open the door for anyone, even if the guy claims to be a survivor like us, okay?" \nFiona, who was doing her final preparations before she went out to gather resources, reminded her younger sister again of the potential threat from strangers. Months ago, Annie agreed to let a child who was asking for help into the house and ended up being attacked by the robber waiting outside. Although Fiona went back in time and prevented any further losses, the scars left on Annie's arm remained a regretful memory for Fiona. \n"Fiona, I'm 16 now. I want to do something to help you support the family." Annie took over Fiona's pistol and made an awkward shooting pose, trying to prove how much she had grown up. \n"Fine. Good for you. You're now a 'big kid' who's as tall as the height of my chest." Fiona replied coldly, snatching back the pistol and holding it high with one hand so that Annie could not reach it. "You're helping me a lot when you stay at home as I say." \n"There you go again! I'm not a kid anymore. I can..." \n"Alright. Alright. So how about this? When you turn 18, I'll teach you how to fight zombies, okay? Now, just stay home and wait for me." \n"Deal!" \nFiona, who went out hunting as usual, did not expect that this random promise would be the last conversation with her younger sister. By the time she returned, she found the iron door, which was ten centimeters thick, had been completely corroded by an unknown poison. The living room was messy. Something bad must have happened. She gripped her gun and walked into Annie's bedroom, only to find a zombie with greenish liquid dripping from its mouth sitting next to her body. The fact was in the apocalypse, humans were not the only ones trying to get used to the changing environment. Zombies were evolving too. They even developed some new "abilities" while eating their own kind. \nFiona, who always thought that she could be there protecting Annie, believed there was no need to make Annie face the harsh reality and the deadly zombies so early. She did not expect that the inability to fight put Annie in danger when a zombie broke in one day. \n"If I had not treated her as a kid and taught her how to fight a zombie, would things be different?"\nEvery night, when Fiona looked at the photo of herself and Annie, she would pose the question to herself over and over again. She would not get any answer though. She could only try to find the answer by giving her trainees strict training and teaching more young people how to fight zombies. \n"My son is only seven years old! You shouldn't be so harsh on him! Look at the wounds on his body. I'm gonna report you! You're abusing him!" In the community, a mother holding a boy with wounds on his body was accusing Fiona of her harsh way of training. \n"Of course, I can teach him later." Fiona said coldly, believing the lady was simply spoiling her child. "Unfortunately, zombies won't wait until a child grows up before killing him."</div><div class="diff-line add">251042=In the serene and isolated suburb, a magnificent manor stood on a hillside surrounded by lush jungles. Away from the bustling city, the place was one of the few "virgin lands" in the early stages of the zombie apocalypse. Yet the situation did not last long. One day, a servant who went out to get supplies was accidentally scratched by a zombie. The moment his crimson eyes opened marked the falling of this secret paradise. \n"Let us go. It's the day for the expedition on the hill!" \nDressed in haute couture, the young master Galande who held young Theodore in rags by his hand argued with the butler who tried to stop him from going out. He had just promised his new buddy that he would take him on a fun expedition; a minute later, he was stopped at the gate. The young master felt somewhat awkward.\n"Master Galande, it's quite dangerous out there. Zombies are found in our manor. The helicopter will be here very soon. Could you wait for a while and continue your expedition until you arrive at the safe zone?" \nAlthough the butler was warning the young master of the danger outside, he did not show the slightest trace of panic at all. He knew they did not need to worry about safety and survival, given the power and influence of the Galande family. He even asked the chef to make a dessert for the young master to find him something to do while waiting, despite that survivors outside were fighting each other for food. \n"What about others? The gardeners and chefs, will they go with us?" \n"You know, the helicopter does not have that many seats." \nTheodore, who stayed silent for a while, posed a question hesitantly. The butler answered him like this in a polite yet decisive tone. Obviously, those "unimportant servants" were not included in the relocation plan in the first place. The butler did not frown for a second, as if the servants' lives mattered not to him.\n"B-but...how can they fight off zombies if they stayed here? They would die." \n"Everyone will die. The weak are only more susceptible. Anyway, you and I are still alive, right? No need to worry about those unimportant to us." \nGalande, who grew up with the idea of "survival of the fittest", could not understand why Theodore cared so much about the servants. He believed he was generous enough to invite Theodore to leave the place together. Why the latter did not appreciate his friendly gesture, and even stared at him with an angry look? \n"You mean the lives of the weak could be given up this easily? Have you ever thought of what would happen if one day you were no longer with the 'team of the strong'?" \n"Ha-ha. No way. I am and will always be the strongest." \n"I see." \nTheodore, who had always been by Galande's side, turned around and left. He refused the "kind invite" to go to the safe zone with Galande. Instead, he ran to notify all servants to leave the manor as fast as they could. Witnessing how Theodore ran towards the servants' room where zombies were roaming around without hesitation, Galande began to doubt himself for the first time: \n"Did I say something wrong? Why would he rather go back to that dangerous place than leave with me?" \n"There will always be such people who can't tell what matters most. It's not your fault, Master Galande. Your way of thinking is quite similar to your father, I have to admit. You'll surely grow up into an outstanding decision maker."</div><div class="diff-line add">251043=The fifth year into the apocalypse, the social order collapsed. The dark side of human nature was unraveled. Fighting, looting, capturing, and oppressing...these became commonplace in major human communities. Amid the turmoil, a team in green uniform committed themselves to restoring social order and stability. They were later widely known as the Minutemen. They were the last gleam of hope in the devastating apocalypse. "Wherever Minutemen go, security and order follow" became the consensus among survivors. \nThe rapid growth of the Minutemen soon aroused the attention of the management of the human community. Afraid of losing its influence and, more importantly, its privileges, the management obstructed the rescue missions of Minutemen. As a result, many missions ended in failure. This made Bolton, an officer of the Minutemen, realize that they needed to "handle" the threats if they really wanted to make the organization stronger. At this time, a soldier volunteered to eradicate the enemies for the organization. \n"Theodore, have you thought this over?" Bolton looked at the young soldier in front of him, trying to remind him what he was doing: \n"The 'lifetaker' we are looking for needs to keep his identity completely concealed. By 'completely concealed', I mean you'll have to discard your identity, face and voice, and every single trace of your existence in the past. To protect other 'lifetakers', they will not be allowed to bury you even if you die in the mission. Are you sure you will accept all these conditions?" \n"Someone has to go. I'm an ideal candidate, right?" Theodore picked up the mask on the table and put it on: "Hmm... It fits me perfectly. Looks like I'm really the right person." \nLooking at Theodore's decisive action, Bolton said nothing more. He handed Theodore the forged identity and more info on the enemies. He then patted Theodore on his shoulder, bidding him farewell with a salute: \n"From the moment you leave the barracks, you will be marked as dead in the Minutemen list. Except for sending you the mission info, we will not contact you in any form. You are all on your own. Theodore...ah, sorry...Roger the Lifetaker, may you successfully clear the way for us and complete your mission." \n"Copy that."</div><div class="diff-line add">251044="D-doc...doc! Please come with me. Unn has gone mad. He kept attacking people!"\n"Alright. Easy. I'll go with you right now."\nWhen Dean dashed into the tent of Jessie the Witch Doctor, Jessie was making some meds with her pot. The clumsy Dean bumped into the pot, spilling all the meds over the floor. On hearing the urgent situation, Jessie left the pot where it was and wiped her hands on her clothes, after which she picked up a few bottles of meds and left home with Dean in a minute.\n"Get out of the way, guys. The witch doctor is here!"\n"Great, it's the witch doctor! Poor Unn can be saved!"\n"How do you do, Jessie!"\n"Thank you for coming here so fast, doc."\nThe crowd around the mad Unn stepped back when they saw Jessie. Everyone greeted Jessie with great respect. Jessie wasted no time and went directly to the patient, who was tied to a pillar by the warriors. He was yelling something at the crowd, with his eyes turning crimson and greenish and sticky liquid drooling from his mouth. As Jessie got closer to him, he began to pounce forward like a ferocious dog. His was so strenuous that the thick pillar was almost moved a bit from the ground. If it was not for the rope, Jessie would have been bitten by him.\n"Watch out! Unn lost his mind. You'd better not get too close to him, doc."\n"It's okay. Anyone knows what Unn did before he developed this symptom?" Jessie was not scared by Unn's attack. In her eyes, the mad Unn was no different from other patients. She also firmly believed that as long as she figured out the signs before he got sick, found the cause, and gave him the right medicine, she would be able to cure him.\n"He didn't do anything special. We just went out hunting as usual. Oh, I remember! There was a weirdo when we came back. Unn asked him if he needed any help and then got bitten by him! That guy's so weird. By the time he came back, he lost his sanity."\n"A weird man? Any other special traits on him?"\n"Let me think. His eyes were red. Saliva was drooling from his mouth. When he saw us, he ran after us! And then Unn got bitten! The man was as lunatic as...as the way Unn is behaving right now."\n"A disease transmitted by biting? Never heard of it."\nJessie went through all the rare diseases in her mind, but failed to find a similar one. This was the first time Jessie was caught in such a tricky situation. She felt a little uneasy, but still forced herself to calm down and pass on the order in time to the warriors waiting behind her: "Dean, move Unn to the tent. Irma, ask if anyone else got bitten in the tribe. Gather them in the tents, if any. Remember, do not get bitten when transferring the patients."\n"Doc, will my dad be okay?" Unn's youngest daughter held Jessie's leg and asked so with some tears left on her panicked face.\n"Of course, your dad is just sick. When we find the cure, he will go back to health right away." Jessie gently stroked the girl's head and answered. It was a promise both to the little girl and the entire tribe.</div><div class="diff-line add">251045=Between dilapidated buildings, a group of survivors with dust and mud on their bodies embraced each other with joy. Just now, they fought off a zombie horde together. This victory proved that the shelter now had the ability to defend itself and secure people's daily production and life. A new human community thus took shape. That night, a celebration event was held. On a cement platform, the host introduced Mr. Lunn, the biggest sponsor of the community.\n"Tonight, we are here to celebrate the establishment of the S community. Now I'll give the floor to Mr. Lunn! Thanks to his generous funding, we could purchase enough weapons to resist the zombie horde this time. Now let's welcome Mr. Lunn to the stage!" \n"Thank you, Mr. Lunn!" \n"Mr. Lunn is really a good man. I heard that he had been running a charity before the apocalypse. He was still so generous in such a difficult time." \n"I want to work in his company. I bet the pay must be good." \nAmid the applause from the crowd, chubby Lunn walked onto the stage slowly. He did not speak anything first, but raised his golden metallic left hand and adjusted the position of his golden tie. Then, under the passionate gaze of the audience, he opened his mouth: \n"Since day one of the apocalypse, Zeus Group has been helping people rebuild their communities and create a better homeland. We are also aware that today's success is built on the efforts of everyone. So tonight, on behalf of Zeus Group, I'd like to invite all talents and craftsmen of the S community to join us! Together, we can create a better future for mankind! Here's also good news for people with disabilities. As long as you sign the contract with Zeus Group, we'll help you get an artificial limb surgery." \nWhat Lunn said was really heartening. The artificial limb surgery made people with disabilities see a gleam of hope. Plus, the name of Zeus Group itself was trustworthy. People all moved to the registration desk on one side of the stage. Looking at the young people who signed their names with passion and great expectations, Lunn nodded with a satisfied smile. At this time, Duke, the host, approached Lunn and talked to him in a low voice: \n"Boss, at least five hundred people will sign up this time, with a hundred of them already signing a "slave contract." I believe...the result is good enough for you to exempt the cost of my artificial hands?" \n"Heh, it's not a 'slave contract.' We call it a welfare." Lunn straightened up and continued with a seemingly compassionate air: "Look at the young men. They idled around in the community all day long. Now I give them artificial limbs and the opportunity to work for us. Isn't this a win-win solution? It's fair for us to charge them 'some' money for this, right? We have to keep our business running, after all." \n"Yes. Exactly, Mr. Lunn. It's indeed a welfare." Duke nodded with a flattering smile. Not receiving any response from Lunn on the money he owed, he brought it up again hesitantly: "So the cost of my..." \n"I see. I'll report it to my superior and lower your interest rate. Keep up the good work. You'll be able to pay it off soon." Lunn patted Duke on his shoulder and said so.\n"Thank you, Mr. Lunn! Thank you so much!" \nDuke thanked Lunn many times for his "consideration and generosity", not knowing the bill of tens of thousands of dollars was actually issued by Lunn himself.</div><div class="diff-line add">251046=Born into a family of doctors, Alisa showed her medical talent from an early age. When other kids of her age were still playing arcade games, young Alisa could name many common medicines and memorize their side effects. Influenced by her parents, Alisa also wanted to be a doctor. As a prodigy, she worked hard and was admitted to a top medical college at the age of 16. \nLater, the outbreak of the zombie virus changed Alisa's life. That day, one could see people wailing and corpses left on the streets everywhere in the city. Hospitals were packed with wounded residents. Even the dorm of Alisa was taken as an accommodation for the wounded. Still, the number of casualties multiplied. Alisa and other medical students were asked to join the medical care team. \nAlisa took the mission and immediately headed to the front line. As she saw the wounds from knives and guns on more and more soldiers, she realized the enemies they were facing were not only zombies but also humans. \n"See? These wounds are obviously left by a knife." Alisa pointed to the long and narrow wound on a patient's stomach and said, "How could a man be injured by a knife while trying to run away from zombies? He was attacked by a human!" \n"Shhh. Stop it." Park Ji-mi, a classmate of Alisa, covered Alisa's mouth with her hands. She let out a breath after confirming that no one looked in their direction. "Do you know how chaotic the world out there is? After the old order was gone, many were trying to create a new order and be the new 'king.' The contention among the factions is in full fledge. You don't wanna get involved, do you? Do your job and take care of the patients. That's it." \n"But they are all ordinary people. They were attacked or even killed simply because they somehow got involved in the contention between those factions?" \n"That's true. But what can you do about it? Restore the order on your own? Don't forget it's an apocalyptic age!" Another peer who did not get along quite well with Alisa mocked her. \n"But..." Alisa was caught speechless. But from that day on, the determination to "restore order" began to take shape in her mind. \n"There must be a way. What should I do?" Every night, Alisa, who tossed and turned on the bed, would think like this: \n"Treating the wounded day by day won't stop more deaths caused by the war. I need to do more. But what exactly can I do? How I wish to find a large group of people who wish to restore the order and work together with them."</div><div class="diff-line add">251047=Headline of World Daily\n"On X/X, the highly anticipated underground railway project finally came to an end. This is the first underground railway in human history. Mr. Pearson, the manager of the project, named the system "subway." Citizens' attitudes toward the new invention were divided. Our special correspondent, Emma, went to the construction site to bring you the latest updates."\n"The first underground railway will start running next Monday. What do you think about it?"\n"Underground? Railway? Eww... That sounds dirty and terrible. I don't need this underground thing." replied Cara, a stubborn and old-fashioned granny in the neighborhood. She continued with a disdainful tone: "With the time and money spent on it, we could have at least two more convenient public transit routes. What's the point of going underground anyway?"\n"That's the first subway ever! Many people want to be among the first batch of passengers! I'll queue up early in the morning tomorrow!" said young courier Jack who appeared to be very interested in the new type of railway. He even took a day off especially to engage in the inauguration tomorrow.\n"Are you talking about that new thing called...uhh...subway! I've heard quite a lot about it." On seeing the reporter, Kate immediately came up to show off the "insider info" she collected: "That subway is designed by Pearson, you know, the guy known for his unbelievable OCD designs! His projects were never delayed or found to be flawed. This subway might bring great changes to the overly crowded city!"\n"Looks like everyone has their own unique insights into the subway. Will it become another milestone in Pearson's career or a flawed design to be polished? We'll see tomorrow!"\nThe next morning, the subway entrance was packed with crowd. In the face of the questions posed by the curious crowd and a bunch of doubts regarding the subway's safety presented by some insignificant news agency, Pearson walked to the makeshift podium next to the locomotive of the subway and delivered his speech.\n"I always believe that transportation is the fundamental factor that drives urban development. Given the crowded and messy urban transportation on the ground, however, I decided to make a breakthrough underground. I know many of you still have doubts about my design. Today, I'll show you how solid the tunnel is, how the smoke is ventilated from the tunnel, and how the safety of passengers can be guaranteed. I'll invite you all to observe with your own eyes, rather than bother you with boring numbers and documents. Of course, I will join you and be the first passenger on this subway. Action speaks louder than words after all."\nAfter finishing his short speech, Pearson boarded the subway. Although many passengers were still waiting on the platform and dared not get into the subway, he did not bother to explain more. By the time the boarding period ended, the red light on the locomotive lit up, with the doors sliding closed and the train starting up slowly and heading away.\n"A new trail has been blazed; the subway will bring us closer than ever!"</div><div class="diff-line add">251048=It was a tranquil afternoon in the community. Thirteen-year-old Laura was collecting metal and paper in the waste transfer station with her friends, to sell them and earn some more money for her poor family. Laura saw Harrison heading her way and she knew Harrison was the one managing the farm of the community. \n"He works with people in the farm and cafeteria, he must have some good stuff in store? At least, he could spare some food for me!" Laura thought to herself. Then she ran to the gate with her friends to greet Harrison. \n"Good afternoon, Mr. Harrison! Let me help you drop the garbage." \n"Oh, it's you, Laura. Thank you for your help then. You may drop the lighter bag for me." \nWith a big smile and sweet voice, Laura took a heavy garbage bag from Harrison. The next second, she opened the bag to see what was inside, only to find some rotten and worm-infested leftovers. \n"All leftovers? How come?" Laura was disappointed and complained: "The food supplied by the cafeteria is barely enough. Many people are staving. Why are there so many wasted food? This is WAY too much."\n"Good question. This is a long-standing problem... To save some time when cooking, the chefs would always take the fresh vegetables from the top, leaving those placed at the bottom stacked there for months. In the end, they all ended up rotten and inedible... Never mind. Why would I tell you something like this? You don't understand how things work anyway." \nHarrison was not able to do anything about it. He also hated to waste vegetables, but he couldn't ask people to cook the rotten stuff. Making people sick would be an even worse scenario. That's why he dumped them right away. \n"I understand things, okay? They were wasted because they were not sorted out in time order. I get scolded by my mom when I leave my toys everywhere in the house. That's how I learned to sort out stuff by size and shape to tide up the place real quick."\n"Good to know. Looks like we need to hire a bright girl like you to help us with our management." Harrison patted Laura on her head and went away. But little Laura took his words seriously. \nSince then, Laura stopped her "treasure hunt" routine. Instead, she stayed all day long in the dark and stuffy warehouse, observing what the workers were doing. Her parents thought she was idling away her time, while the workers found she got in the way. No one expected that a young girl could make some really useful suggestions. Laura did not mind what others thought about her. She bound some draft paper she found in the waste transfer station into a notebook, and used a charred branch as a pen to scribble down her insights into goods management. \nTwo months later, when community manager Wolowitz received the notes drafted by little Laura, he immediately realized the suggestions were quite practical.\n"Good rules are good in nature, despite the age of the rule maker." Wolowitz then put Laura's rules into use in his actual management regardless of others' objections. \nThanks to Laura's suggestions, more inlets were added to the warehouse for goods to be transported inside, shortening the queuing time; some movable shelves were added and more personnel were assigned to sort out the vegetables and fruits, reducing the waste by 30%. The space utilization rate was also increased by a good 20%. Laura convinced others what she could do with her outstanding management skills. More mega communities began to learn from the good practices in logistics and transportation.</div><div class="diff-line add">251049=A baby's cry sounded in the pitch-black woods. That was how newborn Marlen announced her arrival to the world in her blankets. The cries that should have aroused her parents' love and affection, attracted a red-eyed beast - a scarred gray wolf - from the forest instead. After her mate's death in a battle against the king of the wolves, the lone wolf lost her cubs and was expelled from the pack. In desperate need of food, she knew that she would be a meal for other beasts if she failed to fill her stomach. Luckily, she found a vulnerable prey - a human baby. \nAs a bloody mouth approached, Marlen, unaware of the imminent danger, moaned as if pleading for her mother to hold her, as she sensed the warmth of the wolf's breath. The cub-like sound made the wolf falter. She retracted her fangs and moved closer to Marlen, sniffing her repeatedly, as if to tell whether or not she was the cub she had lost. A moment later, she opened her mouth again. This time, she didn't do it to snap Marlen's neck, but instead took her under her belly and began to lick the poor child. The thin milk mixed with the blood from the wolf's wounds became Marlen's first meal in the world. In the warmth of the embrace, Marlen gradually quieted down. It was at this moment that the instinct of motherly love overcame the predatory nature. The wild wolf became a mother and Marlen had a family. \nFeeding on wolf's milk and raw meat, Marlen grew up in the wild. She didn't have the chance to learn how to walk or speak like a human, but with her mother's guidance, she developed a keen intuition like a wild animal and excellent hunting and trapping skills. Although Marlen was somewhat puzzled by the fact that her sparse fur was so different from that of her mother's, the difference in appearance didn't make her less dependent on her mother. She was deeply attached to her mother, and also equally attached to the forest where she grew up. \nThe invasion of the human world by the zombie virus, however, and the dwindling resources of living, caused a lot of people to set their eyes on the forest, where both opportunities and challenges remained. One day, a squad of gun-toting adventurers walked into the forest. Marlen, who was lurking in the bushes from afar, saw them.\nThis type of "animal" with two legs and standing upright was something she had never seen before. They had the same limbs and appearance as herself but spoke a totally unintelligible language. Marlen's eyes were filled with human-like curiosity. \n"What is that, prey? Or an enemy?' \nMarlen was puzzled, yet the similarity in appearance made her begin to mimic their movements. She copied the man with the gun in the distance, slowly raising her own hand, stretching it, clenching her fist, and then tentatively reaching for the stone on the ground. As her five fingers slowly clenched together, Marlen grasped something for the first time. the cold touch of the stone in her palm startled Marlen, who dropped it in a hurry. Without bothering to finish her hunting plans for the day, she went back towards the cave to find her mother. \nHer mother, who was already in her old age, didn't have much to show for today's hunt. After a busy day, she only brought back a small, thin hare. Seeing that Marlen, who had returned to the cave without a gain, she did not get angry. Rather, she limped over to Marlen and got down beside her, using her tongue to clean up the shreds of Marlen's hair. Her mother's embrace gradually calmed Marlen. She wrapped her arms around her mother, repeating over and over in her mind. \n"I'm my mother's child, I'm my mother's child..."\nBut today's imitation of that two-legged animal grasping a rock lingered in her mind. A voice sounded in Marlen's mind:\n"Maybe the creature I saw today has something to do with myself..."</div><div class="diff-line add">251050=When talking about Irma, people in the tribe all marveled at her incredible strength. Carrying logs and digging up ore...the time-consuming and labor-intensive work for ordinary people was as simple as eating and drinking in Irma's eyes. The aged chief also complimented that thanks to Irma, the tribe was able to regain its foothold in the doomsday, which suggested that he considered Irma to be a capable candidate for the next chief.\n"Guys, get up!! It's an earthquake! Quake's coming!"\nIt was late at night when the people in deep sleep were awakened by Irma's loud voice. Before they could have time to realize what actually happened, deafening tremors came. Beds creaked and shook; walls crumbled; as soon as people fled from their homes to the tribal plaza, the dust rolled off the mountains in the distance. Even the sacred stone that always stood at the top of the mountain range fell along with the falling debris.\n"Look! Our sacred stone...the sacred stone has fallen!"\n"No! The falling of the sacred stone...marks the end of our tribe!!"\nAs the crowd exclaimed, the sacred stone, which was part of the faith of the tribe, tumbled down, becoming the last straw that overwhelmed everyone. Everyone was wailing and whining as if they had already seen the future of the tribe's downfall. The warriors who had gone to investigate the situation came back one after another, reporting the latest findings with their heads drooping in despair.\n"Bad news, folks. The sacred stone cut off the river. We tried to destroy or move it, but it was just too hard to move it an inch. By next week at the very latest, or three days at the soonest, our tribe's water source will completely dry up."\n"Things were just picking up these days... Now my tribe is doomed like this."\n"Without water, we couldn't survive for many days."\n"Where else can we go in this sheer wilderness."\nAs the sadness pervaded the crowd, Irma stood out in the silence. "There must be a way. It's not the time to give up yet. Wait, I'll take a look up there."\nThe solid rock indeed sank into the muddy river. Irma attempted to push it, but even with her immense strength, she could only make the sacred stone shake a bit. It was obviously impossible to get the sacred stone out of the way. Irma stared at the stone for quite a while. Suddenly, she clenched her fists and punched the stone with all her force.\n*Creaking... A huge crack miraculously appeared in the center of the sacred stone and quickly widened out.\n"Whatever stone it is, only those that don't get in the way are good stones." Irma, who had successfully tackled the problem, clapped her hands. "But it's hard to find such a hard stone. Guess I'll make a weapon out of it. That would be good enough for a solid stone like this."</div><div class="diff-line add">251051=Duncan was a well-known bounty hunter in the wilderness, but the thing that actually made him known was not his outstanding shooting skills, but his strange principle of taking quests.\nPayment delivered after the job is done? Missions to be carried out late at night? Hunting the elderly, children, or women? An order that had been taken by another bounty hunter before? None of these fell into Duncan's "scope of business." Despite his demanding requirements, however, Duncan still received a constant number of offers from people. They chose him simply because they knew he was the only one who could get the job done with a zero failure rate. As a saying circulating among people went: "Got any trouble? Go find the Ranger; hand him the money, and you'll receive the good news later." The "Ranger" mentioned here referred to Duncan, a unique bounty hunter.\nOn a day when he had no mission, Duncan was savoring a bottle of flavored fruit wine in the tavern. Soon, a stout man with a leather briefcase came in. He first looked around the place, with a typical condescending look on his face as all city dwellers did when they saw the poor condition of this shabby tavern in the countryside. When he caught a glimpse of Duncan, who sat in the corner with his legs crossed, he instantly shifted to a flattering look and approached Duncan with his back bowed.\n"How do you do? You must be the Ranger! I have a bounty quest here. Would you like to have a look?" As he spoke, the man took out a piece of paper with the target's profile. He also patted on his chest trying to reassure Duncan, "Don't worry, this time, the mission is gonna be easy, with rich rewards offered. We have absolute faith in your ability and credibility. That's why we specifically hope to recruit you, Mr. Duncan, for the job."\nOn hearing the man calling his real name, Duncan, who appeared indifferent a minute ago, gained interest and took over the file to have a read of it.\n"Hmm...Zeus Group... daughter of the general manager... Penny?" after confirming the info on the offer, however, Duncan put on a grim face. "Dude, you know I never lay hands on kids. Also, Zeus Group? How dare you pick up a trouble with them?"\n"Ha-ha. Good point. Yes, the girl is with Zeus Group, that's why we decided to come to you." On seeing that Duncan seemed to have an interest in the quest, the man placed the briefcase loaded with banknotes on the table openly, and continued, "As long as the quest is accomplished, all this is yours!"\n"Sorry. Not interested." Duncan glanced at the pile of banknotes for no more than a second, before rejecting the visitor decisively.\n"Wait, I see... How about this? I'll talk to my boss to see if we can double the amount. It's just a kid, right? Easy to handle, especially for you. Our men will help distract the guards. Things will surely go well."\nThe man thought Duncan was only trying to ask for more bounty, so he took out a couple of bank cards from his pocket and threw them next to the briefcase. His aggressive attitude turned Duncan's impatience into a rage. Duncan extinguished his cigarette directly on the man's hand, and warned him in a harsh tone:\n"Don't make me repeat it twice! NO KIDS! You hear me? Looks like you forgot my rules. But today, I don't mind reminding you for the last time." That said, Duncan loaded his shotgun and aimed it at the visitor.\n"Three, two..." he counted down in a slow manner.\n"Alright. Remember! This is no good for you. You'll pay your price sooner or later!" Seeing that Duncan was not interested in any further negotiations, the man packed up his money and left the tavern in a hurry.\n"One!" As Duncan counted to one, a gunshot was fired. The bullet almost scraped the man's cheek and landed on the wooden planks of the doorway. Watching the man disappear from the door, Duncan spat with impatience, pulled down the brim of his hat, and leaned back into the couch to take a break with his eyes closed.</div><div class="diff-line add">251052=Pheidias' bosom was always filled with love for art and romance. Even in the zombie-infested apocalypse, he still believed that literature and art were irreplaceable, and could soothe the heart in the most direct and quickest way possible. As paints and brushes were extremely hard to come by in the apocalypse, Pheidias opted for a more easily preserved and created form of artwork - carving.\n"I hope that people will be able to see an exquisite statue no matter how far away they are. It will be like a lighthouse, guiding every lost survivor to our community."\nAs he spoke of his work, the kindness of a father to his child shone in Pheidias' eyes. He presented his carving idea to the community owner, hoping to get his approval for erecting a giant statue in the community plaza, so that it could become a faith of survival for the people who were muddling through their lives.\n"Pheidias, honestly, I do appreciate your mastery of art. This goddess statue you carved is lifelike. I'm in no doubt that it would definitely be a favorite item if it were to be kept in the art gallery." The head of the community patted Pheidias on the shoulder, not mincing his words in praising Pheidias' talent and work. But when Pheidias believed that he had finally found a community that was willing to accept the statue, the community head continued:\n"But, you know, it's the Doomsday. There are no more art galleries, and sadly, your statue won't do any good. We're having a hard time just surviving. How can we afford to support your carving project of a giant statue? Give up your unrealistic fantasies before it's too late, man. It would be better if you use your insights to find more mining sites for the community, and I'm sure with substantial contribution, all the communities will give you a warm welcome."\nFacing the invitation from the last human community nearby, Pheidias refused again without hesitation. Compared to the tragic fate of getting eaten by a zombie, suppressing his creativity and digging day in and day out in caves were what Pheidias found more unacceptable.\n"If I can't work for my dreams, everything will turn meaningless."\nPheidias began to create on his own in the fallen human community. He might die in a zombie attack in a week, or maybe just a day, but he had no remorse as long as he could die in front of his proud work. The repeated banging noise sounded in the empty and abandoned neighborhood. Many days into his carving project, a horde of zombies came toward this way from afar.\n"Damn, the zombies are multiplying. There are many abandoned houses in the neighborhood. We need to find one and take shelter!" In the distance, a survivor squad surrounded by zombies said in despair.\n"Head...that way!" A scouting member looked into the distance and suddenly saw a goddess statue standing among the buildings with her eyes downcast.\n"Guys! That way!" The member shouted with excitement, his tone filled with hope and thrill, "A place with such a majestic and intact statue will surely be an ideal shelter!"</div><div class="diff-line add">251053="I think we can purify the element through evaporation...look, it's written in the book that it's the safest way to do it." Helen pointed to the success rate of the evaporation method in the book and reasoned her analysis.\n"C'mon. The manual was issued way before you and I were born; it's out of date long ago. I'd say it's easier and faster to just use fire to refine it." Luke picked up his flamethrower and was ready to give it a try.\n"W-wait! The element is too active; contact with fire will cause an explosion!"\nLuke's bold attempt left Helen astonished; fortunately, their mentor came in and interrupted Luke's action.\n"Let's pause the experiment for a while. Come have a look at this." The mentor took out a document labeled with the Zeus Group's logo and placed it in front of the two:\n"This is the first bidding document that Zeus Group has issued to the public since the beginning of the doomsday. It has to do with the field of prosthetics. As you know, our lab is entirely relying on the pathetic funds left. I'm afraid that the lab will have to shut down if we don't get selected for this bidding."\nAs he said that, the mentor poked Luke who appeared completely uninterested in the notice and was already yawning, "You always love to invent weird things like mechanical arms, right? I'll leave this project to you. Helen, assist Luke with the data validation."\n"My invention was something comparable to a work of art, not some "weird thing"! I don't care about the so-called Eden Group or Evil Group; if they don't choose my invention, it's their loss." Luke indignantly defended his invention; obviously, he cared more about his invention than the honor of working with the Zeus Group.\n"Prof, in fact, I've also studied in the field of transplant rejection. As Luke does not have much patience and time for such time-consuming experiments, can you leave this project to me?" Helen, who desperately wanted to yield some fruits in her research, saw that Luke did not look too interested and gathered her courage to seek an opportunity.\n"Oh. But Luke...do you mind...?"\n"Certainly not, that would be great. I don't want to work with those hypocritical entrepreneurs anyway."\n"Well, then, I'll leave you in charge, Helen. You two wrap up and work out a proposal as soon as possible."\nAs she watched their mentor leave the lab, Helen, who had been appointed head of a program for the first time, let out a deep sigh of relief. She then looked over at Luke with a touch of guilt and determination in her eyes:\n"Sorry, Luke. You may not care about the result of the project, but I have to take responsibility for my own future."</div><div class="diff-line add">251054=David's mother was a daughter of an English noble family, and his father was a famous German chemistry professor; David however was born in the vibrant and lively USA. David's parents provided him with a privileged life but also imposed strict requirements on him. On the one hand, he was able to go horseback riding in the western part of the country during every summer vacation; on the other hand, his father asked him to excel in his studies, while his mother expected him to be upright and virtuous. Overall David had a good time as a teenager; at least today, he still misses the period from time to time.\nBut when he started college, he realized that he couldn't handle the various bottles, jars, and experimental rules of chemistry no matter how hard he tried. This frustration took him farther and farther away from his academic pursuits. When he was on the verge of a breakdown, he lay down on the lawn and recalled how he had spent his time gazing up at the stars in the Wild West in his childhood. From that moment on, his life was lit up.\nYes! The stars were what he hoped to explore for the rest of his life. So he began to devote himself to astrophysical research, studied under the most renowned mentors, and traveled to various countries for seminars and exchanges. But on the very day that he was to publish his important paper, a major incident that happened stole the show.\n"A major speech at the United Nations has confirmed the outbreak of an uncontrollable bio-virus; the world will be entering a state of wartime emergency."\nNo one would look at the stars anymore. As an astrophysicist who has been mentioned in textbooks, David's achievement in cosmology has driven mankind's exploration of the universe many times. But when the doomsday came and survival became the biggest threat, the weak scholar had to think about the challenges he faced in survival first.\nFortunately, Roland, the senior of the same college, sent someone to pick up David and accompanied him to Zeus Group, where he was able to continue his research on celestial bodies. David also proved that his research could be of great use even in the doomsday. Whether it is the robotic arm of Roland with unlimited energy storage, or the AI-powered metal ball hovering around David that can both defend him and attack enemies, both of their driving forces came from the meteorites in outer space that he had struck and reshaped after meticulous calculations.\nIt was no exaggeration to say that although David himself was incapable of fighting on the battlefield, his learning empowered him to create the strongest weapons ever.</div><div class="diff-line add">251055=In the eyes of little Laurel, the world was crowded and dirty. She grew up in a holey, leaky bedroom; right outside of her bedroom was the place where her mother, a sex worker, offered "services" to her "clients." The curses and beatings of the clients and her mother's habitual begging for mercy were the only sounds in Laurel's life as she grew up.\nAs she grew a bit older, Laurel began to climb onto the roof while her mother was "working"; Laurel would sit there silently and look out into the distance. There, she seemed to be able to see things far away; her vision traveled over the dilapidated roofs and the high walls of the slum, all the way to the high-rise downtown area, where she "saw" the bustling traffic and booming streets.\n*Sigh* "When can I go there to have a look? When can I leave this place..." The bustling of the city appealed to Laurel. She was desperate to leave this place. Yet as a poor kid inhabiting the red light district, obviously she didn't have much choice in deciding where to go.\nHearing Laurel want to go out, her mother glared at her as if she saw another betrayer: "Where do you think you're goin'? Run away like that irresponsible man who doesn't deserve to be called a father? Don't even think about it!"\nWith a suffocating feeling while crying out loud, Laurel's vision blurred. Her mother now looked exactly like a devil, trying to trap her in this doomed place.\n"Huh. I see. You're no more a little girl, right? You wanna do somethin' to support our family! You do know how hard it is for me to raise you all alone, don't you? Now I'll show how you can make some money and be a 'good girl'..."\nThe hands around Laurel's neck finally loosened; the insane mother ignored Laurel's struggles and put on a new outfit for Laurel, for the first time over the years. She never allowed Laurel to touch her cosmetics in the past, but today she applied a thick layer of powder to Laurel's face. After all this, she even tidied up the house, which was a rare thing to be seen in this house. Finally, she put up a wooden plaque carved with flowers outside of the gate.\nLaurel in her new look was asked to stand outside the gate; poor Laurel had to wait for the so-called "new life" with sheer fear and despair.\n"Zeus Group is always committed to the vision of 'leading the entire society to a new world.' After learning that the children here had no access to proper education and had to work for a living at a young age, Roland, our good-hearted CEO decided to visit this place in person and help the children out of their misery."\nThe young man in a suit stood next to blonde-haired Roland, advocating how benevolent the latter was. Despite Roland's condescending air, people around him still kept complimenting him. Roland, at the same time, was looking for a target among the crowd. He was the only one who knew what exactly was the purpose of this "sponsorship" for the poor children. A few seconds later, his eyes landed on little Laurel standing alone in the distance.\n"Sweetheart, wanna see what it's like to live in the big city? We'll give your parents the best subsidies, on condition that you assist us in some simple experiments..."\n"Sure!" Laurel in fact didn't know anything about the "simple experiments", but still she nodded without hesitation when she heard that she could have a chance to live in the city that she craved.\n"It matters not where exactly I go. At least, it won't be any worse than this horrible place."</div><div class="diff-line add">251056=Kelly was an enigmatic and fascinating woman who stole for a living. Unlike ordinary thieves, she preferred to act in the shadows of the night. She was a top-notch thief, more adept at using shadows and schemes to attain her goals rather than relying mostly on agility and speed, as Galande did.\nKelly used to be an orphan living in the shadows; she didn't know who her parents were or where she came from. She grew up in the dark alleys of the city, making a living through theft and scamming throughout the years. This lifestyle has turned her into an extremely independent and confident woman. It also put her in danger quite often.\nOne day, during one of her thefts, Kelly accidentally triggered a trap and fell into a deep basement. There, she found a mysterious lab filled with all sorts of strange instruments and apparatus. Just as she was trying to run away, a man dressed in black appeared who was claimed to be the owner of this lab.\nHe showed Kelly a whole new world - a world of technology and mystery. He told Kelly that her body and soul possessed great potential; if she was willing to accept his training, she could become powerful enough to rule the world. Although Kelly was not sure about what the man said, she accepted his training tentatively and gradually mastered the skills he taught her.\nAs soon as Kelly mastered all the tricks, the man told her another astounding truth - that he was actually the one who was ruling this world and that Kelly was his biological daughter. Stunned and enraged by this truth, Kelly decided to overthrow his rule and take back everything that was rightfully hers.\nSince then, Kelly went on her quest for revenge. With her skill and intelligence, she planned and acted in the darkness gradually disintegrating her father's rule. Meanwhile, she became the shadow of the city, keeping its peace in the night.</div><div class="diff-line add">251057=Since his wife's death, Maurer aged a lot and became more silent. A good friend of his could not bear to see how depressed Maurer was, so he introduced him to work in an orphanage. There, Maurer maintained the facilities every day and helped the children to repair their damaged toys. Thanks to the lively and carefree children, Maurer gradually regained his hope for life.\nOne day, Maurer recalled that he had promised to make a swing for the children last week, so he grabbed his toolkit and came to the orphanage early in the morning. As soon as he entered the yard, he was surrounded by children of all ages.\n"Uncle Maurer, could you fix my car? Its wheels won't work!" Ken was among the fastest ones; he stormed to Maurer, holding up his toy car with loose wheels and asking for Maurer's help.\n"Heh! It's your little car again. It broke down a hundred times this month! Uncle Maurer, my windmill isn't running... Please take a look at it." Ann, who was a step slower, pushed her way over to Ken, and shoved the windmill, with its fan blade missing a corner, into Maurer's hand.\nOn hearing the children's passionate cries of "Uncle Maurer", he took out his tools with a big grin, sat down on the stairs outside the door, and began to fix them.\n"One by one, okay? Don't worry, Uncle Maurer will fix ALL your toys; no need to hurry."\nThe caretaker saw Maurer, who started to work before he could catch a breath, and knocked on the heads of the naughty kids. She then chuckled, "You always spoil these little kids. Since they know you can fix anything, they're getting bolder with their toys."\n"Ha-ha. It's okay. Toys are toys. They can play them the way they want, as long as they don't get hurt. Who's next? Hand your toy to Uncle Maurer!"\n"Hooray, Uncle Maurer is the best!!!"\n"Ken loves Uncle Maurer."\n"Ann loves Uncle Maurer, too!"\n"Alright, ladies and gents. Uncle Maurer has to work now, and it's time for you guys to go to class. Good kids should attend class on time, right?"\nSeeing several children leaning on Maurer and reluctant to leave, the caretaker talked the children into heading to the classroom smartly. A while later, she returned and told Maurer about the news she recently heard. \n"From what I've heard in town, there's been an outbreak of madness in many places. Many people went mad and attacked others without reason. You live quite far from here, right? Why don't you stay here over the night?"\n"Is it convenient to offer me accommodation? I mean, I'm only a part-time worker here..."\n"We all see how much the kids like you. You'll surely be accepted as a full-time staff member. You'll make a good guard for the kids as well. This peculiar madness sounds too scary. We don't want you to run the risk of getting infected."\n"Alright!

They had no choice but to seek help from passers-by to get some food; the roaming zombies only added to the difficulty of living. After being deceived many times and almost sold by a "good-hearted man", they finally decided not to trust anyone anymore. As a result, they started to scavenge for garbage to make a living.\nAt night, a few huffs and puffs came from the deserted human neighborhood. It was little Tikka who huddled up, clutching only half of a cookie left in her hand, regardless of her rumbling stomach, and waiting for Christine to come back.\n"Ahh...My stomach is rumbling again... No. I gotta wait for Christine no matter what."\nLittle Tikka buried her head between her legs and stroked her empty stomach, as if the comforting gesture could help her resist the temptation of food. Finally, several hours later, she heard a noise from outside the door, and Christine, holding half a hare and a handful of vegetables, appeared.\n"Tikka, I know you must be starving. Sorry, that's all I found today."\n"Stop saying that. You are obviously super good at hunting! See! What a big hare you got." Seeing Christine, Tikka regained energy instantly. She took the food from Christine and shoved the cookie she had saved into Christine's mouth. \n"Alright. Now sit down and have this. Leave all the rest to me! A super delicious dish will be served in half an hour!"\n"I'll wait for the dish cooked by the great chef then." Christine sat aside to make some room for Tikka. She then began to savor the half of cookie slowly. She knew that it was what Tikka especially saved for her; if she refused her, she wouldn't eat anything first without her presence.\nMeanwhile, Tikka took out her sharpened stone knife and dissected the hare. The bloodstained fur could be cleaned up to make a coat; the inedible part could be used as bait for dogs and rats. The guts of the animal, which were something they hated before the apocalypse, were cooked with vegetables over a high heat, making the two little girls forget what they looked like. Despite her young age, Tikka had developed a knack for turning any ingredient into a delicious meal over the harsh days of the apocalypse.\nSoon, the aroma of food came out from the ruins. They two sat in front of the small campfire and started eating the food. Even the lonely night became a little more cozy because they still had each other. Little Tikka rubbed up against Christine, leaning her head on Christine's shoulder and muttering in a low voice. \n"Christine, are we going to survive in the wilderness like this for the rest of our lives?" It was only at this moment that Tikka would show the bewilderment and curiosity of a child.\n"No. By the time we find a safer place to stay, we'll settle down."\n"Is it really possible to find such a place? Those bad people out there only want to take advantage of us to make money for 'em."\n"We'll find one soon, Tikka."</div><div class="diff-line add">251059=When people of the community who had a long day finally finished their work and pushed open the door of the bar, Christine's sweet voice and warm smile could always sweep away their fatigue, and make them chill out despite the suffering and pain.\n"Welcome to the Sweetheart Bar! What would you like to have today, sir?"\n"Gimme a glass of your specialty! I gotta celebrate the big day today!"\n"Sure, a moment please."\nAgainst the lively music in the bar, Christine started to make the drink. The mixer was bouncing up and down in her hands, with ice cubes colliding with each other and making a regular percussive sound, like a beat added to the music. As the song ended, Christine tossed the mixer upward, which leaped several times in the air, and landed precisely in the hands of Christine, who was in an inviting pose. \n"Sir, your Manhattan is ready, have a wonderful night," Christine said sweetly, shoving the orange-colored drink in front of her guest.\n"Thanx!" Benson took the glass with one hand and gulped the drink down, "I mean I've had so many drinks in so many bars, yours is still the best."\n"Thank you, sir. You are really in a good mood today. Any good news that I can celebrate with you?"\nChristine refilled the drink for Benson while inquiring about the information. Inside the bartending utensil attached to her waist, a recorder was emitting a faint red light, which meant it was recording every word in real-time. Under the effect of the highly concentrated spirit added by Christine, Benson, who was in a cheerful mood, couldn't help but boast about his recent findings. \n"I've been searching for the energy ore for years. Finally, I know where it is. It's a big day in my life, cuz when I have the ore, everyone gotta obey me!"\n"Energy ore, what is that? I've never heard of it before."\n"It's a treasure, babe! With the ore, you can get high-powered weapons functioning. And I found it before Zeus Group did. This time, I'll see who dares steal it from me. Nope, I gotta start mining tomorrow morning, in case anything happens..." Benson visualized the scene of his promotion and unrivaled status after getting the ore. He was somewhat unable to sit still and wobbled to get up. \n"You're leaving, sir? See you soon. Feel free to come back if you have time." Christine handed over the weapon to Benson while lifting one hand to stick a mini-monitor between the seams of his weapon. \n"Energy ore? That's an excellent intel...

Coleman, head of the rescue team, signaled his men to take cover, while he hid behind a broken wall closest to the lab with a giant siege hammer in hand.\n"Recon squad ready!"\n"Medic squad ready!"\n"..."\nThanks to the well-organized management of the Minutemen, everyone responded promptly and got into their positions. As the last squad responded, Coleman took the lead with his siege hammer, which was as tall as half a man. He slammed it into the door of the lab; the thunderous sound was like a war horn. It smashed the iron door, and at the same time, made the researchers inside panicked.\n"Who did this? Darn it, where are the guards?!" A researcher who was incapable of fighting back bent down to reach the alarm button.\n"Heh! What are you doin'?" Coleman immediately noticed him and stopped him by grasping his hands behind his back and pushing him against the table, "How many kids did you capture from the community? You did the human experiments, huh? Bastard! Where are they? Gimme the key NOW!"\n"W-wait. I don't understand. We don't have...ouch...kids here." Obviously, the researcher wouldn't confess this easily.\n"Captain! Something's wrong with the wall. It might be empty inside."\n"Lemme see it!" Coleman stopped wasting time with the researcher and left him to his men. He then lifted the hammer with one hand and smashed it towards the wall.\nFollowing a loud rumble, the bricks were shattered and fell, revealing the skinny children squatting inside. When sunlight finally shone into the dark room, the children, who had been frightened for days, cried out loud. Coleman held the youngest one and soothed him with a gentle look that was very different from how he usually looked like.\n"It's alright now, boy.

Alisa, who arrived immediately, started to configure her rescue equipment and anxiously stared at the girl in the rubble who was showing faint signs of life. \n"Wake up, are you still with me? Hold on, we'll get you out." \nThe light from the flashlight shone through the gaps between the rubble and landed on Kobayakawa's face, causing her to frown. Finally, she regained her consciousness. Before she cleared up her thoughts, the inquiries of the people sounded over her. As she was unable to unpack so much info in a short time, the sounds were like noises from a radio to her, intermittent and unintelligible. \n"Ahh... So noisy." \n"Great, she is still conscious! Move faster." \n"Wait, the rock is way too big. How do we lift it?" \n"There are too many obstacles around here; the rock crusher can't get in." \n"Damn, her head is still bleeding. What should we do? Wait, the rock is shaking!" \n"...a rock? Move it away then." \nKobayakawa could finally figure out what was going on around her.

The rescue team was utterly stunned by her force. \n"Geez, what kind of power is this!" \nAmidst the awe of the squad, Alisa walked up to Kobayakawa and looked at the serial number tattoo on her wrist - the unique mark of the Zeus Group's "experimental body." She came to realize that the rescue operation that had been lasting for weeks had finally come to a breakthrough. \n"Inform Mr. Bolton that we've found a survivor from the experiment." said Alisa, who held Kobayakawa in her arms and soothed her: \n"Sorry for taking this long to get you out.
