I see an airdrop of medical kits ahead. Follow me, please.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710473=Where are you going?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710474=(Why did she leave without saying a word?)</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710475=(Looks like I'm treated as a badass. What has happened to human beings?)</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710476=(As things stand, the zombie vaccine seems to be a secret project, and I need to gain Helen's trust.)</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710477=Sorry. I was anxious to check on Dr. Gallo.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710478=That's fine, but it looks like we're still too late.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710479=Now can you tell me about Dr. Gallo?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710480=Dr. Gallo was the first to discover the genetic modification in the ruins.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710481=But soon after he started researching the technology, he saw its pitfalls.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710482=But Zeus Group didn't care, saying the tech is just "not ready" now, then began plenty of experiments at once.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710483=So Dr. Gallo began working on a technique to reverse the genetic modification, which is the vaccine.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710484=But his worst fears were realized.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710485=So Dr. Gallo's technique is still a secret, right?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710486=Well, it was a secret, but looks like it's not anymore.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710487=Why would you say so?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710488=Apparently, the institute has been exposed.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710489=All the survivors who knew about the vaccine were planning to loot the "secret".</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710490=Like what you said, we're too late. The vaccines here have been looted.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710491=Why hide these vaccines? The survivors are really in need of these vaccines right now.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710492=No, Dr. Gallo's plan is to distribute the vaccines to different factions of survivors.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710493=I see. I can help you if you would like to trust me.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710494=There's a secret location nearby where the vaccine is kept.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710495=But it's been exposed, and if you can help me keep these vaccines, I'll trust you.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710496=Let's go.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710497=Oh, no! They are coming for the vaccine!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710498=Don't worry. I'll never let them take it.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710499=Phew...Luckily we got there in time, no, I mean, luckily you are here.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710500=You hurt?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710501=It's okay. I'm not hurt. Oh, good. The vaccines are safe, too.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710502=Now you can trust me?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710503=Sure. Up until just now, I was desperate, but now I can trust you with the vaccine.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710504=That's all right with me. So what's next? What's your plan?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710505=Let's split up from here. I went to Dr. Gallo as planned.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710506=I'll leave the planned vaccine delivery to you, Ms. Palmer!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710507=OK.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710508=The Stations of those factions are too far from here.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710509=I have to figure out a way. How do I get there...</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710510=...</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710511=There's a call button! Fix it, then I should be able to call in the vehicle of Zeus Group.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710512=It's finally fixed. Let me see where the first stop is...</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710513=The clan of Wildlings.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710514=Wait. You are...?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710515=Get out of my way! I saw this vehicle with vaccines first! (impatient)</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710516=...Hi, I'm Palmer. It was meant to be the vaccine delivered to Wildlings.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710517=What? Tut. You must have been sent by Gallo...the flunkies of Zeus Group! Bah!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710518=Oh, you got me wrong. I'm not...</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710519=You listen to me. I don't care who you are. It was I who found the vaccines.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710520=You want to complete your delivery mission? Just send another box of vaccines. Haha...</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710521=Are you...robbing me?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710522=Shut up! Robbing Zeus Group is not robbing! Hand it over!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710523=(Looks like Zeus Group has a bad reputation at Wildlings...)</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710524=(What's next? Let me see...it's Minutemen.)</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710525=Hi, comrade! I'm Alisa from Minutemen.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710526=Please stop. I need details about you and the vaccine.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710527=I'm Palmer from Lawbringers. I'm here to investigate the cause of the zombies.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710528=I've been requested by Dr. Gallo's Laboratory to deliver vaccines to four Factions.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710529=I see. Thanks for your hard work, Ms. Palmer. And thank you for the vaccine!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710530=Oh, by the way, is Dr. Gallo fine?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710531=Unfortunately, I haven't met up with Dr. Gallo. He got separated from Grace among the zombies.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710532=But Grace is on her way to Dr. Gallo, so I'm sure we'll hear from them soon.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710533=Dr. Gallo is sure to come through it. We'll take the vaccines and distribute them to the survivors in the camp.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710534=Speaking of zombies, Minutemen recently found some intel. I don't know if it works for Ms. Palmer.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710535=We don't know if the intel is useful until we hear it. Please.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710536=These days, Minutemen frequently received help messages, and there is a common feature in these cases.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710537=They were all attacked by a monster that is half-human and half-zombie.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710538=It first appeared near a laboratory of Zeus Group.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710539=Half-human and half-zombie? (pondering)</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710540=Thank you. This is a very useful clue!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710541=I'm glad it's useful. Ms. Palmer, thank you for your help!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710542=I'm starting to investigate the monster. Until next time, see you, Alisa.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710543=...(handing over the vaccines)</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710544=...(skeptical face)</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710545=Just say it.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710546=Hello, this is Palmer from Lawbringers. And this is the vaccine for you.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710547=Lawbringers? Just name your price.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710548=Is there some kind of misunderstanding? I'm here to deliver the vaccine for Dr. Gallo...</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710549=Gallo? Ah, he should be responsible for this zombie virus. Now he's crying crocodile tears?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710550=You're working with him? So you're not a good one. Leave the vaccines and get out of here!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710551=...I'm Palmer from Lawbringers. I don't know Mr. Gallo. And Lawbringers is...</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710552=Is what? I know who you are. You call yourself the protector of order. Nothing but impractical. Idiot.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710553=I guess I don't have to explain myself. Have you seen any monster which is half-human and half-zombie recently?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710554=Monster? The biggest monster I've seen recently is you, isn't it?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710555=Preserve order...Really funny. Where were you when the zombies broke out?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710556=Now pretend to be good. Why would you need a parachute if the plane already crashed? Get as far away as you can!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710557=...then goodbye.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710558=Hello, I'm David, one of the Watchers.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710559=Hi, I'm Palmer. In the car is the vaccine Gallo requested me to deliver here.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710560=Much appreciated. With all due respect, are you Palmer from Lawbringers?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710561=Yes, Mr. David. You know about us?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710562=Certainly. But what are your ideas for dealing with the current crisis, Ms. Palmer?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710563=Dr. Gallo has developed a vaccine. We can widely distribute the vaccine from the perspective of prevention.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710564=But Mr. David, if you asked so, do you think there's a better way?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710565=There is no unified belief in the world today, and people are not of one mind.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710566=People are suspicious of each other. There are many serious obstacles to popularizing the vaccine.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710567=You must have experienced this, Ms. Palmer.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710568=Yes, I've been to three camps before, and people have different attitudes toward the vaccine.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710569=It's important to bring together as many survivors as possible to exploit the advantages of human strengths.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710570=You're right, Mr. David. Then there should be a safe, large place to shelter the survivors.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710571=As far as I know, there is a highly secured system at Eden, which attracted many survivors.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710572=But in Apocalypse, it's hard for survivors to find the way. If we can light Eden's beam, we can do more with less.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710573=I see. Thank you, Mr. David. By the way, have you heard anything strange around here recently?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710574=Are you talking about the monster which is half-zombie and half-human?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710575=Yes. Have you seen it, Mr. David?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710576=I heard that a monster recently appeared near the Everest community, the largest human community. You can go there.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710577=Here's what happens.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710578=Everest community?...</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710579=I can go there next.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710580=Can anyone help me? I would give you anything you want!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710581=Please stay calm. Is there anything I can do for you? Take it easy.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710582=I got separated from my family!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710583=My brother and I made an appointment to go to the Everest community, but...</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710584=On the way there we met a hideous, scary monster!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710585=Half-human and half-zombie. Is that what you're talking about?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710586=Yes, it is! They say it's brutal, bloodthirsty, and murderous!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710587=My brother and I got separated trying to avoid it. I am very concerned for his safety.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710588=But we common survivors have no means of communication, so we can't communicate with each other in time.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710589=If you could help me find my brother, I'll give you all supplies I have left!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710590=I don't need your supplies. I will help you. Just tell me where the monster appeared.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710591=I will light Eden's lights as a signal.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710592=After that, you take the survivors of the Everest community to Eden, where you will be reunited with your brother.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710593=OK. Thank you very much!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710594=(According to the resident's directions, the monster is right ahead.)</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710595=(I need to deal with this threat as soon as possible, then light the lights of Eden...)</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710596=...it's you!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710597=I've been looking for you for a long time.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710598=What a coincidence. So do I!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710599=Let the survivor go!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710600=Ugh...(groaning)</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710601=Why don't you just kill me?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710602=You...are you a human being or a zombie?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710603=What? You can't kill me because I'm a human being?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710604=I should have killed you!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710605=If you kill me, I will kill this wretch.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710606=No!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710607=Calm down. You can leave, but you have to let the survivor go!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710608=Hahaha...deal!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710609=Thank you. You saved me.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710610=Your brother asked me to come. He was worried about you.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710611=Come on. Let's light up Eden. So the survivors would gather.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710612=Thank you. We are saved!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710613=Hurry up! It's our big day!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710614=Where is Cloud? We agreed to take this vaccine together!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710615=Shh! The vaccine heist is our secret plan. Don't let anyone hear about it.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710616=I know. Gallo is the only one protecting this batch of vaccine for Zeus Group. It is a piece of cake.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710617=Let's go find Cloud. He went ahead to sniff around.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710618=Okay.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710619=Whew...

Let's go back and see what it was like then.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710799=Wealth itself is a fictional concept.\nBut for the sake of these ethereal things, \nhuman beings constantly and wantonly destroy the order.\nEveryone involved in the research seemed not to understand the consequences \nuntil the disaster struck.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710800=When the order breaks down, so does trust between humans.\nWhat do I need to do to rebuild the trust?\nSomething that should be indestructible \nmust not be covered up...</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710801=It seems that the human race is not hopeless, \nand that the forerunners among the human race are the antidote to this scourge.\nIt is imperative to find the forerunners, protect them, \nand help them understand the order...</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710802=I used to think that organization and hope were a bunch of meaningless nouns, \nbut it was only then that I came to understand that \nhuman survival depends on those meanings.\nAfter all, the organization also helps innocent survivors gain hope.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710803=It has always seemed difficult for me to understand the meaning of regret, \nbut the mere mention of a person's name \nseems to awaken similar feelings in me.\nBack then he was called a monster \nand I missed the chance to redeem him...</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710804=It seemed then that I had finally found a way \ncould restore the order.\nAll I need is a signal \nto spread the message of hope like a seed through a lighthouse, \nto plant the seed of hope for people and lead them...</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710805=Seeing this Palmer again \nreminds me of the humiliating experience \nI had before!\nOr, in other words, the memory of being a human.\nBack then, we had a plan...</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710806=At that time, I thought I was doomed. \nThe abandonment and betrayal of my companions made me fall to the bottom.\nI even prayed for gods and miracles, \nat least back then, I believed in them.\nAll the things I hoped for turned out to be \nthe final straw.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710807=I used to think of Palmer as the god of my dreams.\nBut like the devil, she gave me a choice I couldn't finish.\nHer self-righteous salvation is pushing me into the abyss...</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710808=Mankind will eventually face the aftermath of its own making.\nYes, but the definition of the aftermath is different for everyone...\nI believed I had passed the bottom,\nbut at that time, I didn't know where I was going.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  710809=If the suffering is only my suffering after all, \nI can't get rid of it anyway.\nPerhaps by turning it into a nightmare for all,\nI can wake up.

The radar shows Homelander is in Eden right now!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711060=We gotta let the survivors in Eden get out first. We don't know what Homelander could do to them.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711061=What survivors? If Eden's a lab for V, they're either zombies or dead.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711062=Wait you guys, I just remembered there's a restricted underground area in Eden</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711063=Yeah, she's right. It was always totally inaccessible to the public.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711064=Sounds like we found our X marks the spot.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711065=Hang in there!!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711066=Brady!

Can't even handle a phone call….</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711075=Sorry about the delay. Power is coming back now.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711076=We have the evidence. Vought's behind the outbreak.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711077=Their Compound V experiments turned all the test subjects into zombies.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711078=So what do we do now?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711079=We go back to the fortress and grab every weapon we can.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711080=Let's take 'em all dow.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711081=Oh no…</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711082=Watch out!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711083="Hang on, Butcher!"</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711084=This is it.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711085=Time is ticking. Let’s spilt up.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711086=Alright.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711087=No time like the present to end this once and for all.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711088=Oh another tough guy here. Who do you think you are?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711089=The place is so creepy.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711090=Yep. I feel so weird.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711091=Look! Something's over there!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711092=Watch out!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711093=You hear that?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711094=I think the sound is from somewhere there.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711095=I can hear some heavy steps and low growls.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711096=Looks like it's where classified files are stored.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711097=That's the only clue we have so far.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711098=Let's head down to check the floor below.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711099=Here we are.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711100=Time is ticking. Let’s split up.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711101=Okay.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711102=Look. Here are some supplies of Vought and samples from their failed experiments.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711103=Which means what we found out before was true. Let's go find Starlight now!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711104=Sure. No idea what's goin' on there.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711105=What the f...</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711106=Annie January is as down-to-earth and sincere as they come. \nOriginally "The Defender of Des Moines", her dreams came true with a meteoric rise to The Seven. \nAll she's ever wanted to do is save the world--and while a lot of people say that as a corny catchphrase, she actually means it. \nBut her dream becomes her worst nightmare when she realizes The Seven is where good intentions go to die. \nSince then, Annie has teamed up with The Boys to take down Vought and reveal Homelander's sinister aims.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711107=A former C.I.A. operative turned vigilante, Billy Butcher is as charming as he is cunning. He's a force of nature, who can talk almost anyone into anything, either through a smile or brute force - or sometimes both. He's consumed by one mission in life: to destroy superheroes and Vought. But this personal vendetta is driven by his hatred for one supe In particular: Homelander. Butcher's determined to get revenge on Homelander, no matter the cost. And he won't let anyone or anything stand in his way.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711108=Hughie is an ordinary guy with an ordinary life until one day his girlfriend is tragically killed when A-Train, the speedster on The Seven, runs through his girlfriend. Desperate for justice, Hughie's recruited by anti-"supe"vigilante Billy Butcher, and Hughie's world is turned upside down when he learns superheroes are neither super nor heroic. But that doesn't stop Hughie from falling in love with Starlight. Their romance has its ups and downs but through it all, they remain committed to one another and their fight for decency.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711109=The most powerful superhero the world has ever seen. Homelander boasts many powerful abilities, including flight, super strength, and super hearing. His x-ray vision allows him to see through nearly anything and destroy targets with his laser eyes. Homelander maintains the facade of the ultimate do-gooder, an all-American, God-fearing patriot. But the real Homelander, the one behind the movie star smile is vile, conniving, and ultimately sociopathic in his need for validation, love, and power.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711110=Sounds like Vought.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711111=Born poor on the mean streets of South Philadelphia, Soldier Boy learned the values of hard work, tenacity and bravery. He was VOUGHT's first and greatest Superhero, and was the former leader of the Superhero team Payback. But in 1984, Vought reported he died in a nuclear Power Plant meltdown. The truth of Soldier Boy's fate was not so simple. Previously, The Boys confronted Homelander at a secret Vought facility in Eden only to cause an explosion which disturbed a cryo chamber and awakening Soldier Boy from his long sleep.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711112=A member of The Seven and the fastest man in the world! But underneath the cavalier exterior of a celebrity Superhero lies the soul of a mortal athlete with a deep insecurity about staying at the top. A-Train will do whatever it takes to remain in The Seven, because he knows it's only a matter of time until a younger, faster challenger takes his place -- and that's a problem even the fastest man in the world can't outrun.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711117=Showdown with Homelander</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711118=We do need your radar to continue the investigation.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711119=Event completed</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711120=Here's a room. It looks like a prison cell.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711121=Anybody there? Help me!!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711122=I heard someone's voice. Who's in there?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711123=Thank goodness. Someone finally showed up! I thought I'm gonna die here alone.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711124=Who are you? And why are you here?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711125=I'm Alisa with the Minutemen. I'm held here by Zeus Group.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711126=The badge on your outfit...I saw the same one before on Natalie. Anyway, why did they lock you up here?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711127=Hmm...the lock is quite complicated. It takes at least &lt;color=#FD5E00&gt;4 keys&lt;/color&gt; to open it. Alisa, any idea where to find these keys?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711128=Zeus Group usually keeps their important items in the &lt;color=#FD5E00&gt;Zeus Chests&lt;/color&gt;.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711129=Given the chaotic situation, they might leave behind some of the chests.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711130=Hope you can find the keys in the remaining chests.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711131=Yep. I'll go find them.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711132=I also need to get a few more helpers. The more hands we have, the better.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711133=Keys, Zeus Chests... Ah! Now I remember!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711134=I saw several &lt;color=#FD5E00&gt;chests left behind by Zeus Group&lt;/color&gt; just now. Do you think we should look into those chests?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711135="Wandering around"... Fernando, I knew you were slacking off again!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711136=Let's go have a look at the chest.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711137=...defense protocol disabled</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711138=...alarm system disabled</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711139=...laser scanners deactivated</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711140=...the door is now open</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711141=It feels so good to be free again. I don't know how to thank you guys.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711142=No worries. We gotta help each other in such an apocalyptic time.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711143=My clothes are all stained by dirt. Please allow me to change into a more decent outfit first.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711144=It's so refreshing in clean clothes. Let me introduce myself again. I'm Alisa from Minutemen.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711145=Alisa, we are trying to rebuild this fortress, but there are too many things we do not know of.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711146=I believe you know the place better. So we'd like to invite you to join us.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711147=Sure! It's my pleasure!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711148=In fact, apart from the human experiments, Zeus Group has &lt;color=#FD5E00&gt;a darker plan&lt;/color&gt;. The files are stored &lt;color=#FD5E00&gt;somewhere inside the fortress&lt;/color&gt;.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711149=I'll show you all the secrets of the place if you are interested.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711150=Great. Then what are we waiting for?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711151=There's a &lt;color=#FD5E00&gt;access card&lt;/color&gt; inside the box. Looks like we can open one of the locks of the prison with it.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711152=There's a &lt;color=#FD5E00&gt;Key Card&lt;/color&gt; inside the box. Looks like we can open one of the locks of the prison with it.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711153=There's a &lt;color=#FD5E00&gt;police notebook&lt;/color&gt; in the box. On this page, it reads...&lt;color=#FD5E00&gt;2607&lt;/color&gt;... Is it a password?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711154=There's a &lt;color=#FD5E00&gt;key&lt;/color&gt; inside the box. Looks like we can open one of the locks of the prison with it.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711155=I was trying to stop Zeus Group's human experiments. Unluckily, I got caught. That's why I ended up here.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711156=I see. Lemme see what I can do for ya.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711157=This place is gonna blow!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711158=Run!</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711159=PC in the Prison</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711160=Their experiments failed later, which led to leakage and contamination of the entire fortress. The prison thus became a safe haven.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711161=The first lock is cracked... Do you know what business Zeus Group is doin'?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711162=This lock is cracked as well... Why did they conduct those human experiments?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711163=Looks like the code is correct... How did you make it to survive the confinement here for so long?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711164=Looks like this is the last test.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711165=It's a bio-research giant with tons of funds and advanced biotechs.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711166=For profit, of course. They wish to work out a way to control zombies. A typical example of their "ambition."</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711167=That was a dark time, I have to say. You won't wanna know how exactly I survived...</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711168=Great. Finally, all this is coming to an end.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711169=You need an idle worker to open the gate of the prison.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711200=It’s been too long.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711201=Thank God, you’re back.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711202=And just in time for a little Christmas banger.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711203=He’s kidding… I hope.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711204=Who’s the new bird?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711205=The name is Emma.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711206=She’s an amazing reporter. She can help investigate anything suspicious about Vought.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711207=We’ll see about that.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711208=Can’t wait.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711209=Guys, I just heard from a friend at a major news agency.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711210=Vought is planning for a big announcement at the party.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711211=Let’s split up to cover more ground.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711212=I’ll go with you.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711213=You’ll be recognized immediately.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711214=Don’t you worry hun. I know how to stay hidden.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711215=I’ll come too. It doesn’t hurt to have more firepower.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711216=Homelander will spot you from a mile away. Let Natalie and I go in to investigate.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711217=Fine, you’re right.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711218=Annie and I will stay here to do some digging around.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711219=Do you see that guy in green?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711220=Is that who I think it is?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711221=Butcher was right. Soldier Boy is very much alive.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711222=How could he survive a nuclear incident?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711223=Anyway, he’s here, meaning he’s not dead. And, more importantly.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711224=we don’t know whose side he’s on.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711225=We’d better go back and talk to Butcher.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711226=Stay back. Homelander could spot you in a second. Just let me follow him.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711227=Fine, but don’t be afraid to call for backup.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711228=It looks like he lasered a whole perimeter around the party.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711229=Like a ditch. Why would he do that?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711230=Keeping the rotters out. He's up to something.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711231=Butcher (on comms)</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711232=Wait. Homelander is talking to someone. Who’s the guy in blue?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711233=I've taken a photo of him and am sending it to you now. Do you know who he is?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711234=That’s A-Train, the fastest Supe in the world</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711235=Let’s go back and tell them what we’ve found out.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711236=Have you found anything yet?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711237=You think it’s that easy to hack Homelander's phone?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711238=You’re supposed to be the expert hacker.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711239=Oh! Here’s a message that reads “Operation Christmas Miracle will purge our PR problems…”</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711240=Operation Christmas Miracle?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711241=That sounds ominous.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711242=It’s Vought, when isn’t it ominous?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711243=Homelander is trying to launch a “purge” on Christmas.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711244=A purging of what?</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711245=We’re flying blind. We need more intel.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711246=Shhhh. Look. Homelander is talking to Soldier Boy over there.</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  711247=(This whole party is for you.

Here, we solemnly declare that these are all false and misleading info. Commanders must not be deceived by these illegal offers, as these offers will often result in the loss of in-game assets.\n\nTo maintain order in the wasteland, ensure the interests of Commanders and the security of account info, authorities will henceforth crack down on and punish illegal activities such as third-party transactions and trades severely, including but not limited to:\n1. Accounts that already had transactions made by a third party will have all items and currency involved in the transactions removed. If remaining items are insufficient, Diamonds will be deducted instead (amount equivalent to the items' value)\n2. Accounts with heavy use of third-party transactions will face punishments ranging from temporary bans to permanent bans.\n3. Problems arising from illegal transactions and other related situations are not eligible for compensation.\n4. If losses are incurred from using third-party transaction platform, please resort to after-sales rights protection on the third-party transaction platform\n5. If an account is stolen due to aforementioned third-party transactions, account trading and other illegal activities, the account will not be eligible for recovery.\nIn addition, to ensure the safety of each Commander's personal assets and info, we solemnly remind you that transactions through third-party platforms are not protected and extremely risky\n1. Transactions through these channels have no safety guarantee. Stolen accounts and in-game asset losses are common occurrences for players who use these third-party platforms\n2. Third-party platforms may also steal player account info, or worse, personal identifications. Such info can further cause severe consequences.\n3. Third-party platforms often have an unknown source of funds, resulting in failed transactions regularly, which also exposes players to unnecessary and unpredictable risks.\nWe are dedicated to creating high-quality games for players. We work to maintain a fair gaming environment, which includes securing each and every player's in-game assets. While constantly improving the quality of the game, we also sincerely hope players will work with us in maintaining a fair and balanced world.\n\nLast Fortress Studio</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  900036=Join Our Community Now</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  900037=Dear Commander,\n\nWanna make more friends in the Last Fortress and share ur experience with 'em?\nWanna know upcoming events ahead of others?\nSome of ur great ideas can even be submitted to the devs directly!\nThere’re also fantastic video clips about the game, showing you what the journey in the doomsday is like.\n\nTap the links below to follow us on the following platforms.\nFacebook: Last Fortress\n&lt;link&gt;&lt;u&gt;https://www.facebook.com/LastFortress-101374491782638&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/link&gt;\nDiscord: Last Fortress server\n&lt;link&gt;&lt;u&gt;https://discord.gg/araMngBuES&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/link&gt;\nYouTube: Last Fortress:Underground\n&lt;link&gt;&lt;u&gt;https://www.youtube.com/c/LastFortressUnderground&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/link&gt;\n\nHere you may keep up with latest game info &amp; events, and discuss everything you wanna know about the Last Fortress.

In order to prevent all commanders from being duped and causing losses, we have summarized some of the cheating techniques that often occur in the game to help you to recognize them. \n\nWarm Tips: find the following common fraudulent behavior please report to customer service feedback, we will be the first time to deal with. \n1. Scammers gather players by building alliances and ask to add contact information to trick players into downloading other unsecured games for profit; \n2. Ask to add offline contact information such as WeChat or QQ through various threats or lures. \n\n Deception I: add third-party contact information \n Liar tactics: how much you VX or line, I am ready to pull the group, when the siege is convenient to command \n Deception tactics tactics: friends in the alliance, good morning everyone! Have not yet added my micro (WeChat) are added, WeChat account: xxxxxxx, the name is xx, added to give you a promotion to prevent the next line is kicked not added when the robot kicked, thank you for your cooperation!!! \n\n#Response: real players will not directly so straightforwardly add everyone's third-party contact information, please commander from the source to cut off. Do not add other contact information easily after joining the alliance, after all, it is debatable whether this alliance ally has the ability to act as an ally. \n\n scam two: low price gift package temptation \n scammer tactic: add me to enjoy the lowest gift package discount, 648=480 \n\n # response: this advertising slogan single and easy to recognize, the commander needs to psychologically reject the temptation, please commanders refuse any unofficial recharge channels. Such scams are very likely to include phishing sites, which pose a direct threat to your account security. \n\n scam 3: no guarantee game recommendation \n scammer tactic: friend, are you a newbie or an expert? Come and play another super fun game with me. No need to kryptonite, take you to upgrade for free to experience the feeling of being a super player. \n\n\n\n #response: this is a common solicitation for unsecured games, ruthlessly refuse or just ignore it! The game you are tricked into playing is actually the opposite of what is promised, with poor quality and a very poor experience. \n\nThe above scams still need to be watched by all commanders, pay attention to prevention, beware of being deceived. \n\nLast Fortress Studio</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  900040=Your game account has been forced offline</div><div class="diff-line ctx">  900041=Account connected.
