803015140=Smart as he was, Fernando still had something he was not good at — things that required demanding attention to detail. Wishing he had a pair of nimble hands while sewing a sash, Fernando was upset when he saw the crooked stitches he had made. At that moment, a genius idea crossed his mind: "N.A.T.E., I need your help! Give this a try, buddy!" \nN.A.T.E. began to work on the sash with its mechanical claws and quickly stitched a neat one. Fernando laughed: "A genius like me will leave the right thing for the right robot!" \nNevertheless, at the medal awarding ceremony, the Wisdom Medal, said to be granted to Fernando, was awarded to N.A.T.E. instead. \nAs Brady put it, "Only those who did the actual work deserve the medal." \nFernando scratched his head and mumbled awkwardly, "Looks like the witty tricks alone aren't enough to win some real honor..."
803015141=Everyone who tried their best to live on in such a doomed world deserved due respect. People's roles varied. But even Emma, who watched the kitchen, was equally important in the fortress. Warm-hearted and tough-minded, she kept the diner running on her own. Despite the storms and zombies outside, survivors could always ease their nerves when sniffing the aroma from the diner. \n"The taste of home shall be preserved even in doomsday." From soup of the day to festive feasts, Emma protected people's tender hope and passed on the remaining warmth of this world with the food she made.
803015142=In a zombie-shooting contest, Natalie secured first place once more. Amid the cheers, she handed the Sash of Courage she won to the girl in second place. The inconspicuous young lady with a bashful smile won second place, which surprised everyone. Yet Natalie knew she deserved it. She often saw her practicing for hours at the shooting range. "The extra miles you went deserve the honor. We'll count on the next-gen sharpshooters like you to protect our fortress."
803015143=In a scouting mission, Brady stumbled upon an intact ribbon on a rotten zombie. The ribbon was so clean and unwrinkled. Its previous owner must have cherished it in the best way she could. \n"The ribbon must have meant something to her before she turned a zombie," Brady murmured, hit by a wave of sadness. \nBe it a festive ornament or a gift from the family, behind every little present was a warm memory from the past. Brady picked up the ribbon, and later embellished it with fabric and a metal plate to turn it into a decent medal. It was now displayed on the medal wall. \n"With the hopes and remorse of the deceased, we shall live on no matter what."

803015147=There he is roaming across the wasteland. The knight-type robot still tries to fulfill his duty as a guardian.

803015144=A fire broke out in the warehouse. It soon closed in toward the quarters. As Brady was evacuating residents, N.A.T.E. dashed into the blaze with a fire extinguisher in its claw, and started to put out the fire at targeted spots. Flames and smoke charred his body and overheated many of the components inside. By the time the fire was finally extinguished, he only managed to send out a short message, "Mission complete. Zero casualties," before entering an error-caused "hibernation." After days of repair work, technicians brought N.A.T.E. "back to life", whose "eyes" appeared again on the monitor. On the charging station by his side, a medal of courage lay there silently.
803015145=Every victory against zombie hordes was a hard-won victory. The Fortress was never short of threats and crises. This time, it was the power system, which was wrecked by a bunch of mutated zombies. People had to figure out a plan in sheer darkness. Pulling themselves together from the accident, they soon broke into their roles: Natalie led the patrol team to fight off zombies; N.A.T.E. worked to put the power back on; Brady cleared the path in place of the patrol; Emma helped in the medical tent; Fernando, on the other hand, sang an off-key cadence while trying to distract zombies and threw a handmade flash grenade at them to buy more time. At dawn, the alarm was lifted. The team of five stood side by side in front of the tower, bathed in warm sunlight. At that moment, they needed no medals; they always were the glorious knights of the Fortress.

802001293=[Wasteland Racer] is a racing event open to all alliance members. During the event, complete daily tasks or purchase bundles to unlock alliance rewards and get prepared for the final race. \n1. Matchmaking: Before the event starts, the matchmaking will be performed. Alliances are matched with up to three other alliances of similar strength. Higher-league races mean better rewards. Matchmaking could fail due to failure to join an alliance, insufficient members, or a short alliance creation time. If matchmaking fails, you can still claim personal rewards, but cannot join the race. In the matchmaking stage, you'll be linked to your alliance; changing alliances afterward will make you unable to participate in the event. \n2. Once the event begins, any bundles purchased by alliance members can add to personal and alliance [Diamond Points]. Alliance Diamond Points are the sum of all members' personal Diamond Points and can be used to unlock alliance rewards. Accumulate [Proficiency] through cumulative purchases; complete daily missions to gather [Fuel], to gain an edge in the final race. \n3. Alliance [Diamond Points] and [Proficiency] are unaffected by members joining or leaving the alliance. If you are not in the alliance linked at the matchmaking stage, only personal Diamond Points can be gained; you cannot contribute to alliance Diamond Points or claim alliance rewards. \n4. In the last 24 hours before the event ends, the race begins. Alliance chariots will race to the finish line. Use items to help your chariot get more points. Points and rankings will be updated promptly. Alliance Points gained with Fuel and other items will enjoy an extra Proficiency bonus. \n5. Settlement: After the race will be a short settlement. Rewards will be distributed to the mailbox based on race rankings. Non-participating members cannot receive final rewards. \n6. The number one alliance will advance to a higher-level league; the lowest-ranked alliance will get demoted to a lower-level league. \n7. In [Wasteland Racer], the alliance's league info is linked to the alliance itself, and is unaffected by member changes. In cases of alliance mergers or disbandment, the original league info will be cleared.

605000543=In the [Restricted Energy Zone], <color=#5a8ab7>soldiers will not die</color>; wounded soldiers will <color=#5a8ab7>automatically recover</color> after the battle ends. \n\nWhen the battle starts, the pair of matched alliances will enter the battlefield to compete. When an alliance <color=#5a8ab7>first controls</color> (occupies a facility until it turns into the alliance's color) or <color=#5a8ab7>continuously holds</color> a facility, Alliance Points and personal points can be gained. When the countdown reaches zero, the battle ends; the side with <color=#5a8ab7>more Alliance Points</color> wins. Rewards will be given based on <color=#5a8ab7>overall performance</color> and <color=#5a8ab7>individual performance</color>.
605000544=1. Registration Rules \nThe top <color=#d35251>{0}</color> alliances in power ranking can sign up; their alliance leaders or R4s can complete the registration. Members joining the alliance after the <color=#d35251>registration deadline</color> <color=#d35251>cannot participate in the event or receive participation rewards</color>. Each alliance can have two Legions registered. After the registration deadline, the participant list will be locked and cannot be changed. \nAuto Registration: If <color=#d35251>Legion 1 is unlocked</color> and the alliance management <color=#d35251>does not select</color> a battle session for Legion 1 as of the registration deadline, and the number of members requesting to battle <color=#d35251>reaches {3}</color>, the system will <color=#d35251>automatically</color> complete the registration for Legion 1. The battle session will be determined by the most selected session by members. \n\n2. Participants \nThe participant list is decided by the alliance leader and R4s, with a maximum of {1} key members and {2} backups allowed. <color=#d35251>Each member can only join one Legion (whether as key member or backup)</color>. \nAuto Participation: If there are <color=#d35251>vacancies</color> in the Legion after the registration deadline, the system will automatically fill them with members who applied but are not designated as participants yet. \n\n3. Matching Rules \nLegion matching is based on <color=#d35251>Legion rating</color> and <color=#d35251>win rate</color>. \nLegions registered for the same session will be matched, if any. If no same-session Legions are available, they will be matched with other sessions. The final session will be either of the chosen sessions of the two alliances. \n\n4. Entering the Battlefield \nAfter the Restricted Energy Zone opens, you can enter the combat region. Make sure none of your troops are outside your Fortress before entering. \n\n5. Battle Start \nOn the battlefield, <color=#5a8ab7>your Legion is the blue one</color>, and <color=#d35251>the enemy Legion is the red one</color>. \n\n6. Combat Stage \nStage 1: Basic Refinery, Intermediate Refinery, Medical Center, and Radar will be open \nStage 2: Prep Room and Defense Room will be open \nStage 3: Core Refinery will be open \n\nThe side with more Alliance Points at the end of the battle wins.

When defending a Facility, each soldier killed grants you <color=#7cb75a>{0}</color> Alliance Points and <color=#7cb75a>{1}</color> personal points. When attacking a Facility, each soldier killed grants you <color=#7cb75a>{2}</color> Alliance Points and <color=#7cb75a>{3}</color> personal points. In other actions, each soldier killed grants you <color=#7cb75a>{4}</color> Alliance Points and <color=#7cb75a>{5}</color> personal points. \n\n3. At the start of the battle, participants have <color=#7cb75a>1</color> free Battlefield Relocation attempt. After using the attempt, there will be a cooldown period; 1 free relocation attempt will be restored after the cooldown. \n\n4. In the Restricted Energy Zone, troops will not die; if injured, they will be sent to the Infirmary, which has no capacity limit. All the wounded in the Infirmary will automatically recover after the battle ends. \n\n5. Upon entering the battlefield, troop Durability will be temporarily increased to 200 points. If your Fortress is destroyed, your troops will be forcibly withdrawn to the safe zone. \n\n6. If you leave the Restricted Energy Zone midway, all your troops will be immediately withdrawn; the Fortress construction site will be demolished; a cooldown period will start. You can return to the battlefield after <color=#7cb75a>{6} min</color>. \n\n7.

602103060=Central Eden is one of the few oases in the wasteland, far away from radiation and contamination. It is the last hope for all survivors, and the last glimmer of hope for our civilization. \n\nCentral Eden is rich in resources, with many fertile land. Forests and rivers there make a beautiful scenery. The former prosperity and vitality seem to be restored here. Ancient ruins are everywhere on this land, preserving the glory and relics of the previous era. Many believe that these relics contain the spark that can revive our civilization. \n\nThere are rumors about the forces from the previous era, who made it to survive inside Central Eden. But they hide in the depths of the land, secretly conducting some research and exploration. Those ancient knowledge and technologies may shelter hope for the future. The dream of restoring the previous glory starts here. Some still believe that the land will eventually help us get out of the wasteland and usher in a new hope.
602103061=In the northwestern wasteland, a vast plain composed of rocks and gravel stretches to the horizon. \n\nUnder the scorching sunlight, the cracked earth is covered by sand; the hot air makes the ground seem to twist slightly. The industrial ruins in the distance are like the remains left behind by time; the rusted metal frames and collapsed buildings tell of past glory. \n\nA few survivors have set up simple shelters in the ruins, collecting the old machinery scattered around and refined minerals to make a living. The dust and radiation in the air make people feel fairly uneasy.
602103062=In the northeastern part, winds come from the distant mountains, carrying dust and gravel to this place. The entire world is shrouded in shadows. \n\nFrom time to time, thick smoke billows out of the cracks in the ground; the hot air makes it impossible to stay outside for long. Industrial relics are scattered around across the wilderness, but most of the facilities have been eroded to the point of disappearance, with only a few steel frameworks standing alone amid the sand. \n\nSurvivors struggle to survive in this harsh environment, where one cannot get a single type of resource without taking on huge risks. Mineral deposits are underground, but mining them could be unpredictably perilous.
602103063=In the southeast region, as far as the eye can see, there is nothing but yellow sand. Even the air between heaven and earth appears to be thinner. \n\nThe industrial ruins here have long been eroded by wind and sand; most of the buildings are barely visible, leaving only some broken cement walls and rusty frames to tell the story of previous prosperity. \n\nSurvivors settled down in this barren land, with extremely limited water sources and makeshift facilities.
602103064=In the southwest region, the ruins in the distance seem to be slightly deformed under the scorching sun. They look like countless soulless ghosts. \n\nThe wasteland is strewn with fragments of steel, glass, and concrete. The huge industrial facilities are dilapidated under the erosion of wind and sand. Occasionally, you can see flames or hear the sound of explosions. In this dangerous land, only the bravest dare to set foot. \n\nSurvivors built makeshift shelters around the few water sources and are wary of explorers from the outside world.
602103065=A new oasis on the land; separated by a mountain in between. \n\nThe climate here remains harsh; luckily, the small amount of water left can ensure the survival of some resilient plants, animals, and even survivors. Occasionally, grass and small trees can be seen in the wilderness. The irrigational channels have dried up, but during certain seasons, they could be refilled by groundwater. \n\nThe environment here changes constantly around the year; some areas can become overgrown with vegetation, but swiftly turn into uncovered brownish earth after storms.

Get through all stations of the difficulty level of the week to complete the weekly challenge. In the subsequent week (after the resetting), a higher difficulty level will be unlocked. \n2. Stages: Each station is guarded by different numbers of stationed troops. Dispatch an equal number of troops to challenge them; if all your troops win the battles, the challenge is deemed successful. \n3. Resetting in a new season: When you enter a new season, the Expedition will start at 0:00 (Game Time) on Monday, with the challenge progress and first completion rewards reset. \n4. Weekly Resetting: in S0, the mode will be reset every 7 days; in S1 and later seasons, it will be reset at 0:00 (Game Time) every Monday. Note that the first completion rewards will not be reset at the weekly resetting. \n5. First Completion Reward: the first time you get through a station in a season, you can get the first completion reward. \n6. Sweeping Reward: After the resetting each week, you can clear the furthest station you once completed in the ongoing season with the sweeping feature, and receive sweeping rewards for the completed stations. You can only sweep once each week.

172237=Looks like I was favored by luck after coming here.\nWe found a diary yesterday. It said the place was a giant Fortress, with treasures underneath. Let's see if it's true.
172238=We found the Work Station! Oho! So the diary was real.\nIt also said there should be a space ahead of the cave-in. Let's excavate more!
172239=Had a good sleep last night. So peaceful. But the Zombies growling outside brought me back to reality.\nThe Fortress is our last shelter. We gotta get rid of all risks.
172240=In the apocalypse, we are haunted by hunger all the time. Now the Fortress gave us a ray of hope. Hope we can find some food.\nI can't even recall what it's like to be full.
172241=We're safe for now. But there's a long way to go to survive here. So far, we don't know much about the place.\nWe can be the master here only after searching every corner.
172242=Hard to believe, the Control Center's full of precision facilities. It seems there're many hidden secrets to be unraveled.\nI'm really looking forward to the "journey" ahaed.
172243=We're running out of Mushrooms in just one day.\nI saw many Gophers in the tunnel. An idea popped up in my mind - maybe it's time to add a new dish...
172244=We got two new friends today. They said some Survivors were stuck in a store nearby, and asked if we could do something.\nIt's kinda risky, but we decided to give it a go.
172245=Seeing them leaving for the rescue of Survivors, we're deeply concerned.\nAll we can do is to get prepared before they're back. The Fortress will be even more packed after they join us.
172246=Thanks to our new friends, we found the mine down below. Just then, the rescue team came back.\nThese Survivors will be working in the mine. Everybody's gotta play a part here.
172247=Water's running low. We found something new after a quick search. Brady said soil humidity showed there might be a reservoir on the right of Control Center.\nHope he's right.
172248=We have more faith as the new friends joined us.\nToday we gonna upgrade the Control Center again, to see what we can unlock this time.
172249=Insufficient power! Without electricity, the Control Center will stop functioning. All we've done will be in vain.\nWe need to generate power right away.
172250=Good news! We found a Lab right above the Power Generator.\nThat's the place that interested Brady most. He said once we made a Portable Drill there, we'd break hard Blocks and move deeper.
172251=Brady finally invented a Portable Drill. We'll give it a go to see if it works.\nIf it's strong enough to break Sandstone, we'll be able to build new Quarters.
172252=Our work paid off. Things're back on the right track. But it's only a start.\nWe gotta be strong enough to survive. Labs, Entrance Hall... We'll keep expanding the Fortress.
172253=Last night, Brady found something in the lab.\nIt turned out there's a Satellite Nexus somewhere in the Fortress. The news was overwhelming. So our goal today is to find it.
172254=Just now, we found the Satellite Nexus!\nLooks like it's abandoned for a while, but it remains intact. All it takes is one upgrade to make it work.
172255=We are not alone.\nBut the Zombies outside stopped others from getting close. We decided to do something and fight our way out!
172256=Three hours after we cleared the Zombies outside, the Raven Association arrived and said they'd like to exchange materials with us.\nWe need to think it over and exchange for some valuable stuff.
172257=We gained a lot in the Trade and had a better idea of the value of resources.\nTo be more competitive, we also plan to develop Iron Mines of our own and begin mining.
172258=After days of hard work, we're strong enough to beat Normal Zombies. But this is far from enough.\nWe gotta further strengthen our team.
172259=The trade yesterday was mind-blowing. We knew more about the world.\nEven in apocalypse, some traditions were still maintained, like currency. We gonna learn how to make it.
172260=Brady made some progress in his research yesterday. If things go well, we'll be able to grow mushrooms.\nWhat will it taste like?
172261=The winning battle against Zombies told us they weren't that scary. What scares us most is the unknown.\nIf we want to return to the surface, we gotta face them.
172262=It turned out guns worked best for killing Zombies.\nTo strengthen ourselves and minimize injuries, we'll begin to train the soldiers today.
172263=Natalie said the best way to overcome zombie fear was to get used to it.\nAfter shooting training, we'll go back for zombie hunting. It may become part of everyday training.
172264=Another goal today is to build Infirmaries.\nIn wars with Zombies, we're bound to have casualties. Infirmaries will play a crucial role then.
172265=We'll always find something new everytime we upgrade the Control Center. It's also today's major mission.\nLooking forward to it.
172266=The structure of the Fortress is kinda complicated.\nFor future expansion, we decided to re-design its layout.
172267=The expansion of the Fortress became our everyday work. That's why we need to re-design the layout.\nThe goal today is to increase the population and build Large Scale Mines.
172268=From today on, we'll select the best Commandos to create a Defender Training Camp.\nThis will be the force of our own.
172269=Good news from Brady! He figured out how to grow wheats.\nThen what are we waiting for? Things can't be better. Let's get started! I miss bread!
172270=It's much harder than I expected to create a Defender Training Camp. We're no more than a mob right now.\nWe need real elite fighters!
172271=Day 9 in the Fortress. Things changed a lot!\nWe now have supply reserves and strict training. It's time to see whether our efforts work or not.
172272=The team is large now. We gotta ensure everyone's doing what he's good at.\nIn doing so, people can play their roles well.
172273=Apart from launching attacks against Zombies, we got another goal.\nBased on the info received, there're many important supplies on the ground. Now we gonna take them back.
172274=Ever since we have the Shooting Range, we've been training our soldiers. But we're not strong enough so far.\nIt's a dog-eat-dog world. We need to have more elites.
172275=As the training and hunting proceed, we spot many problems, like the lack of tactics.\nThis is where our weakness lies. Now, let's work on this.
172276=In yesterday's zombie hunting, we were attacked by other humans.\nThis reminds us Zombies are not the only enemy. We decided to launch another attack and flex our muscles.
172277=Up to now, we've become a major force here. In the future, our goal will not simply be to survive, but to conquer the world.\nWe need more hands. The more, the better.

240043=According to the diary, it was a "Fortress".
240044=Power, water, food, trade...seems this place had everything in order.
240045=The residents here basically escaped the horrors of the apocalypse.
240046=The last page details their return from an exploration,
240047=but the diary ends there.
240048=The last page detailed their return from an exploration.
240049=This place might contain incredible stuff, but we should still be careful.
240050=And so, we began the first day in our new home
240051=Everyone huddled together under the dim light of the Diner, with the smell of roasted mushrooms floating in the air.
240052=Though our cups were only filled with water, we celebrated as if they were filled with the sweetest of wines.
240053=It's good to be alive and kickin'!
240054=As we delved deeper into the Fortress, we arrived at its Control Center.
240055=After numerous attempts, we managed to log in to the Control Center
240056=Within 32 hours of arriving, we became the true owners of the underground Fortress.
240057=What a day to remember!
240058=Today, we accommodated a group of desperate survivors into the Fortress.
240059=They couldn't help but gape in awe as they were introduced to the underground Fortress' facilities.
240060=Seeing their expressions always makes me chuckle, as we had the same expressions as them not too long ago.
240061=These survivors were quite fortunate in finding us!
240062="There're too many of 'em!"
240063="Find a way to get this damn door open!"
240064="You're not helping with the yelling! Almost there..."
240065="There we go! Get inside everyone!"
240070=Three hours later...
240071=As a professional electrician, McKinley can also repair cars.
240072=Soon, the old car was good as new with his help.
240073=A FEW MOMENTS LATER
240074=The iron door shut out the danger outside, finally allowing us to have some peaceful time.
240075=It seemed like we went back to the night before the apocalypse, when all the misfortune didn't happen to the world.
240076=The brief escape from life didn't mean things would start all over again. The reality was still as harsh as it could be.
240077=Where are we heading when the night comes to an end?
240078=As the investigation went on, more secrets of the fortress were unveiled.
240079=It seemed quite peaceful at a glance, while all the threats were lurking underneath.
240080=Despite that we were already at the heart of the Fortress, what we've found out so far was only the tip of the iceberg.
240081=There's still a long way to go before we could be the real owners of the place...
240082=In an era where humans were reduced to prey, the only way out was to stay united.
240083=That's why we had some new friends.
240084=Their arrival drove away the loneliness and gave us a gleam of hope.
240085=That's how we spent the first day in our new home.
240086=In the dim light, everyone was enjoying the long-lost peace.
240087=But our nerves did not relax for a second.
240088=Because no one knew what would happen the next second.
240089=As the exploration went on, more secrets of the place were unveiled.
240090=The Warehouse, Gophers and the Control Center... These findings were mind-blowing.
240091=After numerous attempts, we managed to log in to the control system of the Fortress.
240092=Within 32 hours of arriving, we became the real owners of the underground Fortress.
240093=Meanwhile, we were facing great risks though...
240094=Yet we still believed that everything was worth it.
240095=This is a 'blood-stained' survivor's diary,
240096=chronicling the orderly production and life within the Fortress.
240097=However, reading between the lines, we can discern some clues:
240098=resources, food, and trade, all of which suggest a safe haven.
240099=But all of this was lost in a sudden and unexpected rebellion!
240100=The diary abruptly ends on a tumultuous morning...
240101=What happened that day?
240102=Something's not right. We must be careful...
241034=Hammers, pliers, saws, picks... this seems to be a <color=#E5131B>Work Station</color>.
241064=That's all there is! Get these to Emma first.
241071=*huff*...are we...*huff*...safe here?
241072=It should be...
241073=Calm down! We're safe now!
241074=Zombies can't bite through such a thick steel plate.
241079=Found it!
241080=Voila, and then there was light!
241098=Better keep it. It might be of some use.
241099=Heh, guys. Found a hidden entrance here.
241100=Let's head down and check it out, but keep your eyes peeled!
241105=A <color=#E5131B>diary</color>. Chances are we can find out what happened here in it.
241106=Forget about the diary! I can’t even keep my eyes open... I think I'm just...just gonna......gon-......zzzZZZzzz
241107=Alright. I can see you're all exhausted. Let's get some rest first.
241110=These weapons and uniforms...they're all outdated...
241111=20mm bullets? Must be some heavy weaponry around here then...
241112=It's quite a solid door, I can leave it here.
241113=Hey there! Anything I can help out with?
241114=Yes. Be quiet.
241115=Erm, sorry...well...what I wanted to say was...thank you...for yesterday.
241116=Of course! I had it all under control! Erm...but...thanks anyway!
241117=Woo! Look at that big fella there!
241118=Man, using this to annihilate some zombies must feel awesome!
241126=The zombies…they are gone?
241127=They'll be back though.
241140=We're in luck. This place seems to be some sort of underground Fortress.
241141=This place is quite spacious, perfect for constructing a <color=#E5131B>Quarter</color>.
241142=Huh~ I can finally get a good sleep tonight.
241143=I'm starving! I wonder if Emma found anything to eat.
241144=Seems an opportunity for a test run just presented itself.
241145=I hope these mushrooms are edible...
241147=So in other words, there once was a group of people hiding out in this "<color=#E5131B>fortress</color>" as well, but now they're all gone.
241148=This place is practically a paradise!
241149=The tunnel ahead is caved-in, but we can get past it with the <color=#E5131B>right tools</color>. Let's get to the bottom of this place!
241151=Don't wanna scare you guys...but our <color=#E5131B>Food</color> is running very low. I couldn't find a single crumb in this so-called "Diner" either.
241152=I'll go check on the entrance.
241154=I...I'll go with you!
241160=Right then. <color=#E5131B>Food</color>, <color=#E5131B>security</color>, and <color=#E5131B>excavation</color>. Let's get to it!
241161=There's a Work Station up ahead. I should be able to find some tools for clearing cave-ins!
241170=I think I hear something below...
241171=Woo, time to show you a thing or two!
241172=Let's hope you're right...argh…
241173=Emma, You ok?
241174=She's hurt?
241175=Move! Let me see her wound!
241176=Stop! Are you gonna shoot her?
241177=Temperature's normal...no enlarged pupils...she's not infected. It was just a normal scratch.
241178=Phew! I'd rather die than become one of those hideous things!
241179=If you get infected, I'll make it quick and painless.
241180=Hmph, I don't know if I should thank you or tell you to stay away from me!
241181=Don't lower guard now... Fernando, check and see a way to brighten here.
241182=On it! That'll be super easy for an excellent electrician like me!
241183=Ugh... Are you gonna die if you stop bragging?
241184=Hmm, maybe in these cabinets…
241186=I...I just slipped, that's all. If I hadn't, I would have blasted the zombie's head clean off!
241190=Look, there's a door over there.
241191=And behind door number one is....
241192=Learn your lesson, or you gonna pay the price sooner or later.
241193=Hmph.
241194=Did you push me in front just now? If I turn into a zombie, the first one I'm biting is you!
241195=Heh... Turn into a zombie? Then Natalie will get to you first.
241196=This body... Looks like it's been here for years.
241197=What's this...an ID card?
241198=Oh my God! Huh... huh...
241199=......
241200=No no no, wait! Don't shoot! I wasn't bitten!
241201=I know.
241202=You hurt?
241203=I wonder if Zombies can even bite through that thick skin of his.
241204=Hey! C'mon. I really mean it.
241206=Wait!
241207=You idiot! You could've gotten us killed!
241208=S...sorry...
241209=Heavens! Am I dreaming? We're inside a <color=#E5131B>Diner</color>!
241210=Looks like it's been abandoned for a quite a while.
241211=What's that?
241212=Hmm... these stones... perfect <color=#E5131B>building materials</color>.
241213=You're welcome, Mr. "Expert".
241214=Shush!
241218=Oh! That was a close one!
241219=Empty...empty...this is empty...empty again...darn it!
241220=Find anything?
241221=Empty cans and empty bottles...what do you like to have?
241222=Don't worry, there're some <color=#E5131B>mushrooms</color> growing in the cave. We can make do with it.
241223=Mushrooms! I remember seeing some Mushrooms growing in a tunnel earlier!
241224=But...ever since the zombie virus started spreading, all kinds of new bacteria and fungi have started emerging. Are we really gonna risk eating these mushrooms?
241225=I'll give it a try first. If I'm not frothing at the mouth after ten minutes, then we should be fine...
241226=They do look like the edible kind though...I'll give them a try.
241227=Are you really going to risk eating these mushrooms that we know nothing about?
241228=I'll nibble a tiny bit first. If I'm not foaming by the mouth in 10 minutes...then...
241229=But what if they're poiso—
241230=Whew! That was quite the battle...
241231=Whoa! The aroma of food. I smelt it miles away.
241232=No, wait!
241233=Ah! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to steal... Just taste it.
241234=Uh... How do you think of the taste?
241235=Sorry. You know, I haven't had hot food for ages. Umm...super good!
241236=Hey, anything I can help out with? An expert will save you much efforts.
241237=Come clear up the stair.
241241=*Panting* Nailed...nailed it! Phew...where are we heading next?
241242=Follow me.
241245=(Testing)
241246=Mmm, smells delicious.
241253=(Testing)
241257=Really? That's great!
241258=Okey dokey, but to be frank, don't expect it to be delicious.
241261=So, shall we go?
241262=Let's move out, but stay vigilant. I might not be able to save you a second time.
241263=Well, actually...umm...I—I wanted to thank you for yesterday.
241264=You're welcome.
241267=This is probably where drinkable water is stored. Looks quite clean and uncontaminated.
241268=Fernando, head back and tell them the good news first—
241269=I'm on it!
241270=and don't forget to bring an empty bottle!
241271=This is a fortress, but I don’t know why the people here are gone...
241272=There's nothing wrong with living underground -- just a bit too many bugs...
241273=These things have to be clarified. Today I'll <color=#E5131B>investigate</color> further down. As for you...
241274=Okay, but the question is, where have all the people here gone?
241275=Emma, please go find some <color=#E5131B>food</color>, and for the safety of the <color=#E5131B>door</color>... Natalie, can you take charge?
241276=No problem.
241277=!!! The ground is shaking... Was there an earthquake?
241278=Need to keep an eye on the roof terrace.
241279=However, we'll have to clear away these debris first.
241280=Fine, anyway, this is the only choice.
241281=Trust me, everything will be fine.
241282=Done! Smells good, but I can't assure you whether it's safe to eat.
241283=This is not a poisonous mushroom. if you don't trust, I can taste it first.
241284=Wait! Brady!
241285=Just joking. Don't be that serious.
241286=Don't worry, I know it very well.
241287=If I see you sneaking food again, I swear I'll throw you out to feed the zombies.
241288=Wow, I heard that right, right? Emma would actually say thank you!
241289=Alright, buds... Let's call it a day. Time to have dinner.
241290=Could you prepare and cook the mushrooms?
241300=Get out of the way! We gotta do this.
241312=Wait!
241326=No... Zombies are bitting the door! Do something!
241327=Calm down! We're safe now.
241328=Emma, you okay?
241329=Stop!
241330=Out of the way! You will get everyone killed!
241331=If you are infected, I'll make it quick and painless.
241332=Don't lower guard now... Fernando, check and see a way to brighten here.
241333=Look, I found the light switch!
241334=Erm, sorry... I just got a bit excited.
241335=Look.
241336=Geez...is that a zombie tidal wave?!!
241337=NO! I WASN'T BITTEN AT ALL! I WASN'T!
241338=Calm down everybody! Let's figure out what happened first.
241339=How do you think of the taste?
241340=Fernando! You ate up almost EVERYTHING!
241341=No! The zombies are still biting the door! Think of a way!
241342=Can I rest for a couple of minutes now? I'm dead tired.
241343=Not now. We gotta check over the place first. Stay alert!
241344=Don't lower guard now...
242018=Natalie seems to give the cold shoulder to everyone. You think she resents us?
242019=Everyone has their own demons and secrets. She already considers us as companions...can't ask for much more really.
242020=I wanna be awesome like her—fearless and daring—no matter the odds.
242021=Careful! We got movement!
242022=Geez! I saw a pig coming out of it!
242023=Relax, dude. It was only a <color=#E5131B>Gopher</color>. It's kinda chubby though.
242024=This Warehouse is a bit dated, looks like I'm gonna have to renovate it.
242025=So, I got good news and bad news. Which first?
242026=What an original opening. Whatever, let's just start with the bad! Let's see how bad things can really go.
242027=Well it's quite bad! We don't have enough food!
242028=Please tell me you're joking.
242029=Maybe we can venture back to the surface and scavenge for some food?
242030=I think you're more likely to become food than to find food.
242031=Yikes...well what's the good news?
242032=We discovered a ton of gophers in the Fortress, a couple of pounds each by the looks of it.
242033=Nope! Heck no. I'd...I'd rather not eat! No way! Let me fight some zombies instead!
242034=I heard gopher meat is actually quite tasty. Either way, it's better than starving.
242035=You...you're all agreeing on this?
242036=I'm down to try some.
242038=No complaints here.
242039=Then it's decided!
242049=Could this be...
242050=It's the Control Center!
242051=Basically, it's the "brains" of the entire Fortress.
242052=That sounds quite fancy, but this door doesn't seem to want to open.
242053=Looks like it's a sliding door... Here's the card reader...
242054=Maybe we can use that ID card we found yesterday.
242055=Didn't expect there to be a place like this in the Fortress!
242056=You think they still work?
242058=Backup power supply is functional...cables are all connected...there! I'm entering the system!
242059=Ah...but now I need the password...
242060=Wait, I remember seeing a line of random numbers and letters in that dusty notebook. Argh, what were those numbers...
242061=326IM30LCYD. Access Granted.
242062=Awesome!
242065=Don't move. It's an ID logger.
242067=Great! Now we have clearance for some new facilities!
242070=Son of a gun! The screen died! These devices are way too dated to be used properly!
242071=Dated parts? Hmm...
242072=What are you doing!? You're going to break it beyond repair!
242073=Second Work Station opened!
242074=Aha! I used the same trick to fix my old radio back home!
242075=You're amazing Fernando! Now we've got an additional Work Station!
242076=But you can't always rely on your brute force! We should upgrade the Control Center as soon as possible.
242077=Hey, what'd you find?
242078=Oh! The great big guy is afraid of rats! Hahaha! Don't worry buddy, I'll keep your secret to myself!
242079=Heavens my! They're both terrifying! I'm gonna go crazy!
242080=Great news everyone! We've found the most vital location of this place!
242081=The food storage room? Ready the champagne and steak! We partying today!
242082=Well, of course! Each additional day survived is worth celebrating for a fool like you.
242087=This is the Control Center, the core facility of this underground fortress. Now, let me see how we can get inside...
242088=Try the ID card we found earlier.
242089=Woo, that's awesome!
242090=Don't go pushing any buttons!
242091=No fair! Look at Natalie—
242092=Backup power supply is operating normally... The damage seems to be minor.
242093=Who the hell are you?
242094=...I have to say, I got my secrets, but I'm not your enemy!
242095=Fine, a new <color=#E5131B>Work Station</color> unlocked...
242096=New<color=#E5131B> Work Station</color> ? Well, not bad, Fernando got a job now.
242097=Looks like you got your work cut out for you. Grab a shovel and get going, Mr. Expert-at-everything!
242098=Huh?
242099=Looks like we are favored by luck! Gophers can make a great dish these days!
242100=We'll need a <color=#E5131B>ladder</color> to get down here.
242101=It should be able to start up normally.
242102=No joke, those rats were as fat as piglets! I was almost knocked over and trampled by them!
242104=Don't you see? Their existence means we have food now!
242105=Hold up, lemme clean my ears...did you say, EAT THE RATS??
242106=The alternative is eating Mushrooms for the rest of your life.
242107=Uh...hmm...fair point. But catching those slippery rodents won't be easy...
242108=That's where you come into play, Mr. Expert Hunter!
242109=The diary indicates that this fortress was much larger in the past.
242110=That means, there're much more mysteries awaiting us to explore.
242111=Just like a candy house?
242112=Hope there is equipment that can help us return to the ground.
242113=Come on, mate! Without further ado, let's do something now!
242114=Wow! Hard to believe. This is even messier than the place where I've lived.
242115=Looks like it's a <color=#E5131B>Warehouse</color>. Check out these boxes. See if there's something we need.
242116=With these stones, we would be able to build more rooms.
242117=There must be some kind of facilities that will consuming this large amount of coal, like Power Generator.
242118=The warehouse is so well-organized that it can accomodate more materials.
242119=I hope your inventory list does not contain gophers.
242120=Gophers? You are right. Gophers should be of some use elsewhere.
242121=Did you say, EAT THE RATS??
242122=Trust me. The taste of Gopher will never let you down.
242123=Woo. My mouth is already watering. Let's try some. Why wait?
242124=I'll leave it all to you. I feel sick at the mere thought of it.
242125=Aha, wait for the delicacy then.
242126=This should be the <color=#E5131B>Control Center</color>, the core of the entire underground facility.
242127=<color=#E5131B>Control Center</color>? But how to get in?
242128=Look out! Zoombies!
242129=Hope the facility still works.
242130=The repair of the Control Center was finished, and another area was unlocked.
242131=Hope that's not a waste of our time.
242132=Got it! a brand new area has now opened to us.
242133=As the level of the Control Center goes up, it seems that we can access more areas.
242134=Be careful, it doesn't feel right here.
242135=Don't try to fool me! I can tell when you're lying.
242136=Okay, I trust you, but I hope you could tell us your story someday.
242137=If what the diary says is correct, the Control Center should be right behind the door.
242138=Now the issue is how to get it open. Emm...lemme see if we missed something...
242141=The card.
242142=Yep! The card we found earlier! Why didn't I think of that!
242144=Look! What's that...?
242146=Woo, awesome! You're really "Natalie of all trades"!
242147=... A <color=#E5131B>Work Station</color> was unlocked on our upper right side.
242148=A <color=#E5131B>Work Station</color>? Ask Fernando to go up and have a look. Emma, go check it out with Fernando.
242149=Okey dokey!
242150=It doesn't matter... Anyway, I ain't your enemy.
242151=Then lemme put it this way: how much do you know about the place?
242152=We gotta <color=#E5131B>have the Control Center fixed</color>, for all other functions are under its control.
242153=The diary said the place was a giant structure. But the thing is, it seems to be quite the opposite.
242154=That's not hard to explain. Cuz what we see right now is no more than the tip of an iceberg. Something must have happened here.
242155=So...what we gonna do?
242156=Keep going. I got a hunch some stunning secrets are still out there awaiting us.
242157=The diary says there're many <color=#E5131B>facilities</color> and <color=#E5131B>supplies</color> down here. So the goal today is to find them. Let's move!
242158=Why you seem to be so familiar with the place?
243001=Guys, we're running out of water! The water left will hold out for two more days at most...
243002=I think I saw a water stain on the right side corner of the Control Center. There must be a water source nearby.
243003=Well, what're we waiting for? Let's get crackalackin'!
243008=Oh thank goodness, I'm still breathing! Thank you, thank you all!
243009=Halt! Arms up, and don't even think about making any sudden movements!
243011=No, please, we're not infected! We don't have any weapons either!
243012=Check 'em
243013=All's good. They're perfectly normal.
243014=Sorry friends, gotta be extra careful nowadays, right?
243015=Of course. Our group was scavenging for food in a supermarket when zombies rushed out from the warehouse...
243016=Don't worry, you guys are safe now. We have plenty of space in our Fortress for you guys to stay in.
243017=I can't thank you enough! But...my friends might still be alive. Can you consider rescuing them? Please, they're the only family I have left...
243018=Where are they?
243019=To the southwest, about 3 to 4 kilometers from here.
243020=That's way too far. We'll never make it there alive.
243021=Please, I beg you! They're all capable people with different skillsets, like me! I'm an electrician! There must be a way to save them!
243022=Well, maybe there is a way...
243023=Help, anyone!
243024=Break time's over buddy. Take another trip with us.
243025=SIR FERNANDO! Please stop shaking the table!
243026=What the hell are you talking about? I didn't move an inch.
243027=You didn't? Then why is the hell shaking?
243028=Zombie Tidal?!
243029=Thank god! We're safe! Thank you for y...
243030=Freeze!
243031=Wait! Wait! Hold on, Madam! We ain't gonna hurt you.
243032=Then stay put. I gotta make sure you’re not infected.
243033=I'll leave it to you.
243034=Sorry guys. You know, in a world like this, we gotta be extra careful.
243035=It’s okay. The city we came from was sieged. Hard to describe how we make it here.
243036=Heh, stop it. Because you're lucky enough to have me, your lifesaver.
243037=Perhaps you're right. But some of our friends are still stuck on the way here.
243038=Forget about those suckers. They're doomed anyway.
243039=You...you bastard! You just promised we would go back to save them.
243040=Innocent boy! You'll also get killed if you get out again!
243041=Listen, my friend. First tell me where your friends are?
243042=They're in an abandoned supermarket in the southwest. Only 5 miles from here.
243043=Don't be silly…there're zombies everywhere, and we'll get killed before we walk there.
243044=Walking is certainly not an option. But there might be another way worth trying.
243045=Hey dudes, you found something new?
243046=An abandoned <color=#E5131B>Mine</color>, right below the Control Center.
243047=There's not much of it, but they're enough to let us hold for some time.
243048=A <color=#E5131B>mine</color>? Not bad. May be of some use.
243049=I am an expert in cleaning the Mine, but there seems to be some sound inside...
243050=Ahhhhhhh! Something is moving! ...Help!
243051=Finally, it's done. I hate clearing Zombies.
243052=Do you want to check again? I feel sick just thinking of their faces!
243053=No need, I've done that.
243054=Let's go back and let them know.
243055=Speaking of vehicles...maybe I can help.
243056=It's all blocked. We gotta break those <color=#E5131B>blocks</color>.
243057=The water here looks quite clean and uncontaminated. Our hard work finally pays.
243058=Woo. Look. An artificial Cistern!
243059=I think it was built by former Residents. Anyway, we don't need to worry about Water for a short time.
243060=Wrap it on me, I'm a water transport expert!
243061=...and don't forget to bring an empty bottle!
243062=Thank you.
243063=Could you give me more?
243064=Finally, we got the meal.
243065=Compared to the world outside, this place is practically a paradise.
243066=We will have more chances if the jeep can be fixed.
243067=Oh, man, it's downright broken. You know what? I was a car mechanic. I'll see what I can do.
243068=It just looks a little bit broken, but it should still work. Dude, let's fix it!
243069=Phew... The overall check-up was done. The old buddy is ready to go!
243070=Woo. Hard to believe. My old buddy is good as new.
244001=At last, we finally found the Fortress' Power Generator...
244002=As long as the main power generator here is active, there'll be no need to rely on that poor emergency generator.
244003=What needs to be done then?
244004=The Coal we found in the Material Warehouse can be used here.
244005=Let's get to it then!
244006=We can consume <color=#E5131B>Power</color> and <color=#E5131B>Scientific Components</color> to research various technologies. Let's just start with <color=#E5131B>Mechatronics</color>.
244007=Great! With <color=#E5131B>Mechatronics</color>, those <color=#E5131B>Sandstone (Lv.2)</color> won't be a problem for us ever again!
244008=I don't think such a heavily reinforced door was constructed to protect some boxes.
244009=I discovered all the wires in the Fortress extend in this direction.
244010=Seems we found where the Power Generator is then!
244011=Check it out. There's a giant box behind the giant door left of the Control Center.
244012=I bet there's some magnificent treasure in there!
244013=Now we just need to find a way to open the door!
244014=Did you guys notice the Laboratory above the Power Generator?
244015=Of course! It can function normally now that it has power!
244016=Laboratory? Is that where technology is researched? That's so cool! So, what are we researching first?
244017=Mechatronics! We'll be able to deal with that pesky <color=#E5131B>Sandstone (Lv. 2)</color> once we master that technology!
244018=Friends! It's about time for an overall improvement in our home! I propose we upgrade the Laboratory to Lv. 2 first.
244019=The reason being?
244020=Once we upgrade the Laboratory, we can research even more technologies, such as one that makes catching gophers easy as pie!
244021=Ready, mate? We're about to begin construction now!
244022=But first, these Density <color=#E5131B>Sandstone (Lv.2) </color> need to be cleared away.
244023=Time to show 'em the power of "Mechatronics"!
244024=Commander, where's the "something something easy as pie" technology you promised?
244025=In the Laboratory! What was that technology called?
244026="Gopher Wheel".
244027=Is this room empty? So what was that noise just now?
244028=It could be a gopher... I'd better check it first and make sure it's safe before you come in.
244029=Eh….that….I'm having a slight stomache now. Wait for a second, please!
244030=Circuit board, gears…now we can make some ice creams？Woo…That's so exciting!
244031=No… more important job is we have to research the <color=#E5131B>Mechatronics</color>.
244032=Mech….mechatronics? What's the use? I prefer to have some ice cream.
244033=<color=#E5131B>Mechatronics</color> can allow us to break those hard <color=#E5131B>Sandstones (Lv.2)</color>, so we could expand the Fortress.
244034=Are these culture tanks for cloning technology? ! How many secrets are still hidden here...
244037=Rome was not built in a day. At the moment, we need to research Mechatronics with technological components and electrical devices.
244038=Did it work? Natalie, let's see what we can get this time.
244039=Patience, boy! Sometimes things are not what they look like.
244040=<color=#E5131B>Power generator</color>? That's great! The Fortress has Power Facilities now.
244041=Woo! So that means we could have airconditioning now. That's cool! Let's take a look!
244042=Careful! We got movement!
244043=Damn it, can't these things lie down all the time!
244044=I've finished checking now, and there's no fuel left inside the generator.
244045=Fuel is not a problem, there is some Coal available in the Warehouse.
244046=A…box? Are you serious? That's so disappointing!
244047=The Power Generator is operating normally! Need any other help, bud?
244048=Hmm... Just now at the Power Generator, I heard strange footsteps upstairs. It's like something's running around...
244049=Don't worry. I'll go up to check it.
244050=What? It's done...
244051=...Fernando, remember my advice... Recklessness will hurt everyone someday.
244052=S-sorry... Uh, a room upstairs is open, let's go take a look.
244053=Are you still planning to rescue the survivors today? Our rooms are almost out of place!
244054=I tried to expand... but all the Blocks are hard <color=#E5131B>Sandstones (Lv.2)</color>, which cannot be excavated with a shovel.
244055=So, we can only watch more and more people coming and crowding together?
244056=Let me see... The diary states that the original scale was much larger than the current one, and there must be tools that can dig the <color=#E5131B>sandstone (Lv.2)</color>.
244057=You are right.
244058=I just found a way to upgrade the Control Center. If it succeeds, it should be able to solve the problem of Block Excavation.
244059=This is already the third time! It seems that it is receiving signals but cannot be connected. Is this device broken or not?
244060=I have checked it out, and the problem is not on the device.
244061=That's weird, ha, let this expert check it again!
244062=Hmm... I seem to have seen the pattern above before... Yes, the Control Center!
244063=Control Center? Maybe it has something to do with its Level.
244064=Wow!!! What was that just now? Zombies that can generate power?
244065=Maybe it's just a gopher, I'll check it out first.
244066=Security question - just leave it to me!
244067=Phuuu... Do we really have to expand? The soil here is harder than the diamond!
244068=Harder than diamonds? You are really an expert in finding excuses.
244069=He's not finding excuses. The soil is mixed with <color=#E5131B>sandstones (Lv. 2)</color>. Not a chance to dig it with a bare shovel.
244070=So what? People are getting more and more. Are we gonna fit all the people in this space and have nightmares face to face?
244071=It's gonna work! Remember what is said in the diary? It used to be much bigger than it is now.
244072=Bigger than now... So what? Can you turn back time?
244073=Hey, ease. I mean there should be some tools for excavation. We just haven't found them yet.
244074=I'll go check the Control Center again. Hope I can figure out how to break <color=#E5131B>sandstones (Lv. 2)</color>.
244075=Come on in. The room's clear.
244076=Circuit board, gears...
244077=Woo, this is a Laboratory!
244078=Try to use these components to assemble tools like drills.
244079=If we can make it, we'll be able to crack those hard <color=#E5131B>sandstones (Lv. 2)</color>!
244080=The upgrade was done. The Gate to the <color=#E5131B>Power Generator</color> is open!
244081=This is the Power Generator? Do you hear the sound from behind the door?
244082=...That's from zombies. Sounds like there're a number of them.
244083=Then go get someone! Do you wanna fight with them like this? Just we two alone?
244084=Or what?
244085=Ouch, it hurts my arm!
244086=Stop, the earth is much harder than it used to be, and it's useless to dig down this way.
244087=Then I have to take a rest first ---- Don't be lazy!
244088=Picks are only fit for excavating some <color=#E5131B>Clays (Lv.1)</color>. For <color=#E5131B>Sandstones (Lv.2)</color>, we need some tougher tools.
244089=Not a single lump of coal in the generator? Phhhh...such a boomer thing.
244090=Go check the <color=#E5131B>Warehouse</color>. You'll find some there.
244091=It's locked from the inside. Let's go get some tools?
244092=Why bother?
244093=Wait, you mean...
244094=Please! Give me a notice next time! Almost scared the shit out of me.
244095=Now shut up and get ready.
244096=What's goin' on? The power is out? My soup's spilled all over the floor.
244097=Ouch. I slipped just now. I can still feel the dull pain in my butt.
244098=It's the problem with the backup power supply -- the power's running low.
244099=Oh, no. It sucks. What we gonna do?
244100=Not a big deal. There's gotta be another power supply.
244101=Power supply? Any idea where it could be?
244102=Hmm... What do you think, Natalie?
244103=I think the answer would be the Control Center.
244104=Boss, the generator is ready.
244105=Good. Now let's see whether we got it right.
244106=Fernando, turn off the backup power.
244107=Copy that! I'll switch it off in 3, 2, 1...
244108=Aha! Boss, we made it!
244109=Good job! The power is quite sufficient. Could save us a lot of trouble.
244110=Hey, Brady!
244111=Look! There's a room over there.
244112=Room cleared. Come in.
244113=Circuit boards, gears... Geez, what a mess.
244114=What kinda place is this? A lab?
244115=I guess the table already told us the answer.
244116=These're...some designs?
244117=Yep. With them, we could try to make some tools.
244130=Look! Here's a way to somewhere below.
244131=Hold on a sec! Tell others to come here. I'll stay here for now.
244132=Geez. We got us in a huge trouble!
244133=Shhh! Chubby guy. You gonna attract 'em all here.
244134=Take it easy. We can handle these couple of Zombies.
244135=Natalie, now it's our turn.
244136=The next destination - ticket office.
244137=Watch out! There're a few more down the stairs.
244138=What we gonna do? it's pitch dark down there!
244139=We gotta look for a torch or somethin' before getting down.
244140=Perhaps...we can check the electricity in the switch room.
244141=Good idea. Let's go.
244142=Booyah!
244143=Help! H.E.L.P.!
244144=Freeze!
244145=Don't shoot! I'm not infected. And I can help!
244146=Get over!
244147=...That's basically what happened so far. Hordes of Zombies are comin' this way! For real! We gotta do somethin' before it's too late.
244148=With all that's being said, got any plan, dude?
244149=See the room over there?
244150=The control room of the metro?
244151=Yep. It's occupied by Zombies. If we can take it back, we still stand a chance to bump those things away with the metro.
244152=Sounds it's worth a try. Let's go get it.
244153=Metro system activated.
244154=What's goin' on?
244155=Let's check it out. Stay alert!
244156=Look—
244157=Damn! There's no way to get into the metro with the big fella standing in the way!
244158=Then get rid of him. We're running out of time. Follow me!
244159=Who's there? Come out!
244160=How's it going? Can you start it?
244161=Getting ready! Everybody, stand firm!
245001=Is this...another Control Center?
245002=Doesn't look like it, it's quite different from the previous Control Center.
245004=Is there any way to reboot it?
245005=They might be covered in layers of dust, but the devices are still in decent shape. Shouldn't be a problem for me!
245016=Woo! The screen is on! Look, it's really a satellite screen!
245017=Do these red dots indicate survivors? Why are some signals strong and some weak?
245018=The signal strength represents the CP - The stronger the signal, the higher the chance of survival.
245019=So, can these survivors be contacted by satellite?
245020=Not a big deal. We can give it a try.
245021=Contact those with a high chance of survival first. If successful, we are able to recruit reliable fighters!
245022=Welcome friend.
245023=This place is amazing! How did you guys manage to find this place?
245024=It was nothing really, we're just the beneficiaries of this Fortress.
245025=But let's talk about you.
245026=Me? ...Not much to talk about really, I just focus on gathering resources and surviving!
245027=Resources? Are there still lots of resources outside?
245028=You bet! There's a large abandoned industrial area near here that's practically full of treasure, so to speak.
245029=There are lots of zombies in that area as well. Exterminate them first, and you'll be able to gather resources in relative peace!
245030=Ugh...those ugly things again...
245031=Hate them all you want, but don't forget, zombies have all sorts of items on them. In a sense, they're a source for "resources" as well!
245032=Some extremely repulsive resources...
245033=More survivors are joining our Fortress. Soon we won't be able to rely solely on the resources within the Fortress.
245034=Plus, certain resources can't be found underground.
245035=Perhaps it's time for us to return to the surface!
245036=Are you willing to lead the way Akendalf?
245037=I'm yours to command!
245038=I found some thick wires to the right of the Control Center.
245039=They're called "communication cables".
245040=Communication cables? Does that mean...? No way!
245041=Nothing's impossible. Let's continue exploring!
245042=Huh? What's with the competition?
245043=Don't you know? These zombies are my "Exclusive Resources"?
245044=Stop pretending. You were already here!
245045=...
245046=You...you must be blind!
245047=Whatever you say, chief...we don't mind an extra member; there are enough zombies here to go around!
245048=Does that count as an invitation? If so, then I accept!
245049=We rescued an excavation expert!
245050=Excuse me. I'm actually a geologist.
245051=Okay, the great geologist. We now need your help in those mines.
245052=Just let her distinguish herself at the Stone Quarry!
245053=I've figured it out! The rooftop facility with the helicopter is actually a trading post!
245054=Butter my butt and call me a biscuit! There are still people doing business out there?
245055=That's human nature for you. As long as there's profit to be made, there'll be humans!
245056=What I meant to say is, we can consider it when the need arises.
245057=Based on its power usage instructions, activating it requires ample amounts of Power
245058=Try it out now
245059=Guys, thanks for taking me in! To be honest, I haven't killed enough zombies yet, but I do need a safe environment to rest.
245060=It sounds like you are good at fighting and dare to hunt zombies?
245061=Dare to hunt zombies? No, to be precise, it's a kind of enjoyment! This is my greatest pleasure.
245062=I found a lot of supplies in the warehouses along the way to the north, which can be given to you as gifts, but the quantity is a bit large...
245063=This is not a problem, we can go and bring them back, but it has to be safe.
245064=Don't worry, there are not many zombies in that area - it's the result of my long-term efforts.
245065=The Level Up is complete! The newly unlocked area is above the laboratory.
245066=I'll go investigate it right away -- I believe this is another surprise.
245067=What? Am I dazzled? Is it another Control Center?
245068=No, it's quite different from the previous Control Center.
245069=Here should be the Satellite Nexus.
245070=Satellite Nexus? It's unbelievable... Is there a way to restart it?
245071=The device is in good condition and can be repaired.
245072=Great, what are you waiting for? Just give it a try.
245073=You mean there's a Satellite Nexus somewhere in the Fortress?
245074=I dunno. The diary says so anyway.
245075=Hey! Fernando. Shut up or get out!
245076=We gotta find it ASAP. Chances are the clues are still in the Control Center...
245077=I got it started. Connect the Radar now.
245078=What's up?
245079=...Radar connection disrupted. Someone needs to go up to the roof to check it.
245080=The Radar was fixed. Let's give it another shot.
245081=Done. Now we can send out and receive satellite signals.
246001=Look, the detector is going off! Based on the readings, it detected Iron!
246002=Guys, I think we just found some veins of Iron!
246003=Awesome!
246004=Ho! The Iron Mine construction has been completed!
246005=Now we just need workers.
246006=Assign some idle residents to the Iron Mine to begin mining!
246007=My stomachs grumbling...I wonder if there's any food in the Diner.
246008=You've already had three meals today!
246009=Really? That many? *Sigh*...Is there any way to get more food?
246010=Perhaps we should try researching "Fungus Cultivation."
246011=What should we do next? You know me, I get fidgety if I'm idle for too long!
246012=Let's construct a Mint!
246013=We'll need coins to construct advanced facilities in the future!
246014=We're becoming mightier by the day!
246015=Then it's about time we fight our way back outside and expand our exploration radius!
246016=Only be fighting constantly can you survive in this post-apocalyptic world!
246017=-- May 3rd --
246018=York was bragging about the chick he met at Brandt during tonight’s patrol again. Every time man, every time he gets drunk, he starts mouthing off. Honestly, I’d wager a month’s worth of ration tickets that none of the things York said he’s done were true.
246019=-- June 4th --
246020=Yesterday, Captain Ove led us north on a search for supplies. Everything was going smoothly until, well, it didn’t. In one of the last rooms we checked, the ceiling suddenly caved in, and a zombie landed on top of us. Although we put down the zombie immediately, Johnny still got bitten. He just sat there, crying, whispering for us not to leave him, but he knew the rules. He knew we had no other choice. That’s what I keep telling myself as well, but even so, I couldn’t bear looking into his pleading eyes when I pulled the trigger. What kind of a coward am I?
246021=-- June 7th --
246022=Those bastards from the brotherhood are getting increasingly outrageous. If the situation continues like this, something major is going to go down for sure. Oh great, now what? There’s some big commotion outside. I swear if the brotherhood instigates another-
246023=Hey man, here comes the trouble! A small group of zombies is approaching our ground stronghold.
246024=A small group... From the look on your face, I guess it won't be difficult to deal with.
246025=Natalie, go to command the teams on the ground, and I will provide you with support.
246026=Okay.
246027=Friends, long time no see.
246028=Hey, my friends! Do you know what has happened in the outside world recently?
246029=What's good in a world full of zombies?
246030=A great event that could affect the entire world - the "Alliance" has been established!
246031=Alliance? What is it?
246032=In fact, there're much more survivor squads like yours.
246033=Now, they plan to cooperate, share resources, and help each other... this is the so-called "Alliance"!
246034=Sounds great! But I guess that's not all you want to say?
246035=Haha, that's right! In fact, many people have already joined the Alliance, and I'm just here to ask your opinions.
246036=Join the Alliance?... We need to think about it.
246037=That's all right. I expect you to make the right decision.
246038=What is your opinion on whether to join the Alliance?
246039=I know. It's hard to keep going with the few people we got.
246040=So, just make up your mind, and I'll support it either way.
246041=That's right! I believe you too.
246042=That's fine with me.
246043=... Well, let's at least give it a try.
246044=Hey baby, just come over here! Otherwise, I'm not sure I'll shoot your head off with a bullet!
246045=Perfect!
246046=Hey, someone comes to open the door!
246047=Drop your gun!
246048=Damn it, what kind of hospitality is this? You just invited me here!
246049=Calm down, my friend. She meant no harm. You know this is a special period.
246050=Special period... You're right. So you guess if I would drop my gun as she said.
246051=Understandably, this is your right - but so are we.
246052=Alright, man. You have a reason. But I also came here with great sincerity.
246053=I have a batch of supplies outside, but I cannot take it by myself. Can you go with me to get them?
246054=Going outside? Declare in advance, don't count me in!
246055=It's rare for our expert to have a clear estimation of himself.
246056=I'll go with you. But don't try to play tricks.
246057=Woo, the Garage is super large. Awesome!
246058=The vehicle is spacious enough to fit in a whole team. Awesome!
246059=That's right. It's time to fight back. Let's begin organizing the team.
246060=Geez! Come over to the top of the Diner. Guess what I found?
246061=Where is it? Gotta make sure it's safe enough to enter.
246062=Safe enough? Huh, I can only say it's gonna be okay if we could be armed to the teeth.
246063=Strength matters in this world. But what can be more powerful is money.
246064=Save your words for me. Here're some Z Coins for ya. Remember, money can be your superpower.
246065=Just take it. A gift for a friend. I never make bad deals.
246066=Check out the stuff I picked up from all places. Take it if you like it.
246067=Oh, I ain't seen any smart customer like you for a long time!
246068=These're some real good stuff for Fortress upgrading. Don't regret it if you don't take it now.
246069=Great deal! Don't miss out!
246070=Short on Z Coins? You came to the right person.
246071=You know what? I'm short on resources! How about exchanging for some Z Coins with me?
246072=Signal decoded. The requester's name is Rebecca...
246073=Wait! What? Rebecca?
246074=Yep. What's wrong?
246075=If that's not another person with the same name...that should be an old friend of ours.
246076=Yes. We once lived together in a "castle" and I knew she had a crush on me.
246077=C'mon. You wanna taste the bullets? Don't forget Rebecca's a sniper.
246078=Alright, guys. Now locate where she is and let's move.
246079=See? I said there's somethin' wrong with the radar! Waste ten more minutes like this, and Rebecca will be turned into a zombie.
246080=Stop your nonsense and shut up!
246081=Search again then. This time it'll work.
246082=See? I told you the radar...
246083=SHUT UP!
246084=Stop it. It's not the issue with the radar. It's probably because Rebecca's in a car.
246085=Damn! I'm done with it! Why the hell does she keep driving like that?
246086=Don't worry. I found the note she left at the last stop.
246087=You sure it's left by Rebecca? What language is this?
246088=It's the code once used by the military in the "castle." She marked her location on it.
246089=You mean the Minutemen? That is to say, you're also...
246090=That's a long time ago. Okay, guys. Let's go!
246091=Never expected we could find you here. Come out, dumbass!
246092=Let me go, bastard! Or you'll all be doomed!
246093=Huh, I don't know what's going on between you and Rebecca, but you'd better not piss me off.
246094=I bet you are not as stupid as what you appear to be. Tell me where Rebecca is, and you can leave.
246095=Let's wait and see! You'll pay the price!
246096=Rebecca, look! This is our new home.
246097=Looks pretty nice. It's not very large, though.
246098=Haha. Let's go down and take a look. I promise you'll be surprised.
246099=Wait, Rebecca. What's going on with the Matthew? Looks like he was trying to attack you.
246100=He's with the Vindicators. I believe he had something to do with the exposure of the "castle." -- What happened then? You let him go?
246101=Looks like things were more complicated than I thought. I thought the "castle" was engulfed by zombie waves. Now it turns out that a bigger intrigue was behind it.
246102=Remember what people always say -- in the post-apocalypse world, humans can be more dreadful than zombies.
246103=Intercepted a signal -- from the Minutemen.
246104=The Minutemen? Huh, thought they disbanded already after the "castle" was taken by Zombies.
246105=Check out what happened.
246106=Squad 5 stuck in zombie horde. Need assistance...
246107=Geez. It's Rebecca! She's alive! Rebecca, you hear me?
246108=Save your efforts. She can't hear you.
246109=We gotta save her!
246110=You know her?
246111=We lived in the same residential quarter -- the "castle" -- and I knew she had a crush on me!
246112=You wanna taste the bullets? Don't forget Rebecca's a sniper.
246113=She shouldn't be far from here. Locate where she is. Let's move.
246114=Ohooo! This is our new home. Welcome!
246115=Thanks, but show me around later. Lemme use the Radar first.
246116=*Beep* ...HQ! HQ! This is Rebecca.
246117=...Rebecca? You're alive? What happened?
246118=We ran across the zombie horde in our quest for the Vindicators. And I was the only survivor...
246119=What? But the Radar shows Woody is heading north... Don't tell me he's turned...
246120=Listen, we can't leave him behind. We'll be in huge trouble if his locator is taken by the Vindicators!
246121=...Got it. I'm on it.
246122=Woody did a good job. His death was saddening, though.
246123=Saddening? I thought you would be happy that you don't need to pay back the ration coupons you owe him.
246124=I can see how disappointed you are. Well, c'est la vie. Life and death issue becomes commonplace nowadays.
246125=On another note, were all your strongholds compromised?
246126=Yeh, exactly. It sucks. Not a single warehouse was left.
246127=Then you got somethin' to do. Ask a few friends to help you take the three warehouses back.
246128=Now we go to Warehouse 9. Let's go get it.
246129=Ahh. Are we gonna leave again right now? We just got here!
246130=C'mon. Aren't you sitting there all the way?
246131=Alright. Save your energy to kill a few more Zombies.
246132=Things're going unexpectedly well. But Rebecca is in trouble now. A horde of Zombies in the southeast are approaching her.
246133=Oh, hell. Why there always are Zombies wherever she goes?
246134=You're right, dude. She's like a magnate to Zombies. Anyway, as friends, I believe you won't sit back and leave her behind.
246135=Well done! Guys, thanks to you assistance, we took back a lot of stuff.
246136=Thank you for your appreciation -- it's not as helpful as mushroom skewers though.
246137=Don't worry, my friends. We Minutemen will never forget who helped us.
246138=What's the plan next?
246139=Stand by here. Don't forget your mission. The Vindicators will not give up easily. Stay ready for the real battle.
246140=Distress signal detected!
246141=…Hey! Is anyone there receiving this? I am Major Rebecca of the Minutemen. I am surrounded by zombies. Requesting help!
246142=It seems that we are not the only survivors. Let's lock up and get ready to go!
246143=Welcome to our new home, Isn't that cool?
246144=It's really cool, but I don't have time to visit. As a major of the Minutemen, I have to check if the supplies are safe.
246145=Everything's fine. But our guards are missing. We gotta find them.
246146=I guess they are in trouble. Let's go find them.
246147=We didn't suffer much this time. But the bad news is we have a traitor among us.
246148=Any idea where the traitor has gone? Let's go get him!
246149=He's way more cunning than we thought. He brought the zombie waves here. Luckily, we retreated in time.
246150=But his location was compromised. I'll get him myself this time. I swear!
246151=Looks like there's more than one traitor. There must be something behind all this...
246152=I agree. Our next move would be looking for other friends scattered elsewhere.
246153=Through satellite maps, we can observe everything on the ground, thereby locking the target location.
246154=Cool! Let's see where the target is!
246155=Wow, I can see the Fortress!
246156=Destination locked! Let's go.
246157=Oh, God! There are zombies everywhere...hey, I saw Rebecca!
246158=Hey, Rebecca! Are you ok?
246159=You have come at the right time. I'm running out of bullets!
246160=Haha, all done!
246161=Thank you. I almost thought I was done. I'm glad you're here in time.
246162=I was out on a mission for a while. Can anyone of you tell me how the community fell?
246163=This is a long story, let's go back first. We found a nice place.
246164=Guys, can you accompany me on a trip? The position has been synchronized to your radar.
246165=Did the supplies get eaten by the zombies? There is nothing here except a few zombies!
246166=They're my guys, bastards. What the hell happened?
246167=The fatal wounds are gunshot wounds! They were shot and killed...
246168=It seems necessary to take the body back for a full examination!
246169=…Test results came back. It was a wound from the same gun. Shot at close range. Formed not more than 3 hours ago.
246170=In other words, the attackers have not gone far, we still have a chance to find them.
246171=Count me in. I will make these bastards pay!
246172=The target has been locked, but the risk factor in the area is high, and we need help.
246173=Guys, get ready to move — hey! Rebecca, don't be so mad!
246174=...Damn, they are also members of the Minutemen! This group of traitors, I'm gonna take them out myself!
246175=...6 killed and 4 ran away.
246176=This result has exceeded expectations. Don't just chase after the enemy, but also pay attention to supplies.
246177=Can anyone tell me what happened to the zombies all over the floor?!
246178=Looks like we're being set up. Let's find a way out of this!
246179=Target is in range.
246180=Good, ready to fire!
246181=2 killed themselves, and the rest were killed.
246182=Copy that! But I always felt something was wrong...just to be safe, prepare to retreat!
246183=We got something! A geologist named Diana called us for help.
246184=Diana? Before the castle community fell, the platoon commander sent her to investigate a piece of mineral that is claimed to be related to the zombie virus.
246185=In other words, maybe she can help us solve the mystery of zombies!
246186=Ha, this is interesting! There are ruins everywhere, I think Diana might need an excavator more than us.
246187=So you can't work alone — Hey! Diana! Can you hear me?
246188=...I'm in the innermost room, there are a few zombies outside, and I'm afraid to come out.
246189=You did very well! Hold on, let us give the zombies!
246190=Oh, god, thank you! thank you all……
246191=Don't be afraid, it's okay, we will take you to an absolutely safe place.
246192=What do you say about that mineral? I remember on the run, I put it right in the EdenCorp's building.
246193=EdenCorp? This is arguably the most iconic building in the neighborhood. Let's go.
246194=It's unbelievable! The community's largest EdenCorp is so desolate......
246195=Now is not the time to sigh! There is a dangerous atmosphere here. It's best not to let your guard down.
246196=I nearly got scared me to death by all the Zombies that came out of nowhere!
246197=Shut up, you stupid pig, any more calls will draw more zombies over!
246198=Stop arguing, I have already looked for it, the mineral is not here. Let's go back and talk about it!
246199=The mineral is gone? How? I put it in the EdenCorp...
246200=Someone should have taken the mineral, and We found traces of it at the scene.
246201=The results are in. The men who took the ore should not have gone far and now there is still time to chase them.
246202=Wow! I saw them! Get ready!
246203=Be quiet, there are more enemies than expected, don't alert them!
246204=I'm afraid it's too late! They've found us. Prepare to break out!
246205=Aftet the number of people was counted, the entire population was successfully evacuated, without loss of life or injury.
246206=No! I'm shot! I got shot in the ass! !!
246207=All right buddy, it's just a scratch. We gotta get back.
246208=These people are well-equipped and well-trained. To be honest, I can’t even imagine where they came from?
246209=I'm sure they had something to do with the Zombie attack. Now that their car is broken, we must not miss this opportunity!
246210=According to the radar, they will enter this area in 10 minutes.
246211=Ha ha! I feel enthusiastic! Wait till you see this genius!
246212=Come on, boy, I look forward to your performance, don't let me down!
246213=These bastards destroyed the mineral before killing themselves. Damn, the clue is broken again!
246214=Don't be too upset. At least we figured out who the enemy is.
246215=Yeah, the uniforms and logos they hid under their coats...They must be from EdenCorp!
246216=Guys, the radar has captured new signals! A group of survivors.
246217=Probably escaped from the castle community, too. There's no other living community around here.
246218=Get ready to go. We'll have a new partner again!
246219=There was one missing when counting the number of people just now. It was a young man named Jack Chang!
246220=Jack Chang? ! We have been looking for this guy for some time!
246221=Those survivors said that he was just a courier. Why did you minutemen want him for?
246222=It's a long story. Anyway, he accidentally took away a piece of intel, and if he finds it, he might be able to find out what happened to the community.
246223=Among the survivors who were rescued, someone said they saw Jack Chang leave alone two hours ago, heading southeast.
246224=He can't go far in this short time. Natalie, can you find out where he is?
246225=No problem-the target is successfully locked.
246226=Dont kill me! Dont kill me! Please!
246227=Don't be afraid, we are here to save you... You mean someone's after you?
246228=Yes... please, help me!
246229=Don't worry, we will protect you, so let's go back to the Fortress first!
246230=The intel is in that letter? God, no wonder the people from EdenCorp are after me...
246231=EdenCorp? Are you sure you read it right?
246232=Wrong? How can it be! I saw them wearing EdenCorp uniforms with my own eyes!
246233=Listen, I almost got killed! That's why I hid myself!
246234=All right! Relax, you are safe, let us prepare a surprise for EdenCorp!
246235=I found that there were some gunmen from the EdenCorp, and they seemed to be looking for something.
246236=It's a rare opportunity to say hello to them!
246237=A big win! How about opening a bottle of champagne to celebrate?
246238=Don't be too happy. Those were just cannon fodder!
246239=The point is, we didn't get the intel either.
246240=I detected their movement, about 5km northeast.
246241=Save the champagne until next time! Ready to go, guys!
246242=These killers are suicidal, and the clue is broken again!
246243=There may be clues on the corpse. Let's take them home!
246244=The opportunity to open the champagne is gone, and the killers destroyed the intel before they killed themselves, and we're all out.
246245=But at least it proves that it's got something to do with EdenCorp, and sooner or later they will show the fox tail!
246246=Found a ground warehouse, there should be a lot of supplies.
246247=It's time for action!
246248=I found a letter left by a farmer named Harrison, who had taken refuge here and left here a few hours ago.
246249=Harrison? Then we can celebrate together, guys!
246250=Just a farmer, what's to celebrate?
246251=If I remember correctly, before the castle community fell, Harrison seemed to be a supplier to the EdenCorp?
246252=Bingo! So Harrison is very important to us.
246253=Found it! Harrison is about 15 km northwest.
246254=The area is packed with zombies. Hurry up! We must save Harrison!
246255=It seems that there are no zombies here, please search carefully!
246256=No? Is all this a conspiracy of the EdenCorp?
246257=It's just speculation at the moment, but all clues point to EdenCorp.
246258=The EdenCorp said before that it would send someone to pick me up...God! Do they want to kill me?
246259=I’m afraid you’re right, but don’t worry, we will treat them well!
246260=This is the place where EdenCorp and Harrison will meet. Get ready for ambush!
246261=Let's hope it doesn't become another war of annihilation — at least let me get one alive.
246262=If you learn to fight, you can't catch a bullet.
246263=You are right this time—Attention, there is movement ahead!
246264=Can anyone tell me what the meaning of this battle is? How many zombies to kill? Where are the people from EdenCorp?
246265=I guess they didn't plan to come! Lenovo’s previous community fell, maybe they have mastered the ability to control zombies...
246266=Well, the usual topic! But even if this is true, the manipulator cannot stay away from the battlefield-in other words, the enemy is still nearby!
246267=Hey, Brady, there are some sneaky guys in my scope, can I shoot?
246268=Sure! But again, if you want to catch them alive, don't aim their head!
246269=These guys are really scary, they would rather kill themselves rather than surrender! Are they brainwashed by EdenCorp?
246270=But they can't destroy all the clues, at least we know that EdenCorp does have a way to control the zombies.
246271=Attention. A gardener called Lafite Marceau is calling for help. At a place where used to be a plantation.
246272=A plantation? If I remember correctly, that's where EdenCorp is located. That is to say...
246273=Let's check it out then. Let's go, buds!
246274=Oh, geez! Look at that. The place is like ten times the size of a soccer field! It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.
246275=Alright. No time for complaining. Don't forget Lafite is still waiting for us. Let's split up and look for her.
246276=Thank you so much! I thought I was gonna die.
246277=All is over now. We'll take you to somewhere absolutely safe.
246278=Here's what happened. EdenCorp asked me to cultivate a new plant. Then the "castle" was fallen. I was thus stuck in the plantation.
246279=The plant... Do you still have any of it?
246280=No. The place was destroyed by Zombies. But EdenCorp would transport some plants to the bio base regularly. You may take your chances there.
246281=The place is more like a zombie base than a bio base... I can even hear the Zombies growling in there!
246282=Looks like EdenCorp already gave up on the place. Hope they at least secured the plants Lafite grew.
246283=That is. The plant! Well done, buds!
246284=Thanks. Lafite, please continue your research. We need to figure out what's behind all this.
246285=I need some special fertilizers. Without them, the plants won't grow. Well, the thing is, the fertilizers were all taken away by EdenCorp.
246286=Umm... That's a real issue. I remember there's a barn behind the bio base. Let's see if we can find any there.
246287=Over there is the barn of EdenCorp.
246288=Much larger than I thought, but looks long abandoned.
246289=Be careful. We'll split up after getting in.
246290=Oops. It's not our lucky day today. There's nothing in there!
246291=Check out the footprint. The color of the dirt is different from the soil around here. Take some and go back to analyze it.
246292=We got the result for the dirt on the footprint! There's only one area nearby that has soil like this.
246293=Good job. Locate where it is. Get ready to go!
246294=A warehouse. The fertilizer should be in there. Telling from the growl, there're quite a lot of Zombies inside.
246295=Time to flex my muscles. We've been tackling EdenCorp for a while. Can't wait to see how they beg for pardon after tasting my fists.
246296=Bravo! Then I'll be able to continue with my cultivation experiment!
246297=We'll count on you, Lafite. Bring back the good news.
246298=Got a message from Rebecca on wireless. She's calling for help.
246299=What the heck with the woman? She's been out on patrol for no more than two hours!
246300=Perhaps she's in trouble, or found out something. Anyway, let's go find her.
246301=You really gotta fix the 80-year-old car. I've been waiting for a good 4 hours!
246302=This is the first time I see you in such a mess. Tell me what happened.
246303=I'll tell you when we go back. Now help me handle the killers of EdenCorp first.
246304=So you were attacked while searching the abandoned warehouse of EdenCorp? That's weird.
246305=God knows what these bastards are up to. Almost lost my life there!
246306=Simply complaining won't change anything. Come on, let's go teach them a lesson.
246307=Target is in range!
246308=Hey, Rebecca. Now it's time to let them know what it means to act against us.
246309=Copy that! One shot, one kill. None of them is gonna get away!
246310=Brady, why the grim look? What's up?
246311=I was looking into the movement of EdenCorp. They might have a stronghold not far from here.
246312=If it's not far, we might try to find where it is.
246313=See? That's the stronghold of EdenCorp. We may move anytime.
246314=Then what are we waiting for? Go get it, buds!
246315=Heh, Fernando. Why you got so excited? Are you gonna take the lead?
246316=Stop kidding me! I mean, don't you see Natalie and Rebecca are ready to have a good fight?
246317=From what we got this time, we can see EdenCorp was aiming at the abandoned warehouse. There must be something important in there.
246318=Looks like it's long abandoned. Not likely to find anybody there.
246319=Indeed. That's why it seems so unusual that EdenCorp is interested in a place like this.
246320=Hey, everybody! I'm Mario, a plumber. Are you here to save me?
246321=Save you? Wait! Where did this... Mr. Chubby come from? Almost scared the shit out of me... Heh, stop looking at me like that, Fernando. I wasn't calling you!
246322=Alright. Enough. Mario, how we are going to treat you depends on who you are and what you want.
246323=I guess you will be happy to leave with us.
246324=Of course. The first time I saw you, I knew you were not bad guys!
246325=Thank you for saving my life. When I was working in the warehouse, a horde of zombies gathered outside. I got no where to go but to stay here. EdenCorp once came here, but those idiots left me here like this!
246326=What did they do here?
246327=They took away something. I begged them to save me. Never expected that they began to shoot at me! These bastards! Luckily, a lady with you distracted them from here.
246328=I see. We got here too late. Don't worry. We'll make EdenCorp pay for what they did to you.
246329=Someone responded to my radio transmissions. 20 km in NW. Isn't that an empty space? Weird...
246330=Perhaps that's someone like you. Out on a mission before the "castle" was fallen.
246331=Make sense. Hope the guy is one of us. But if it's someone with EdenCorp, I would get even more excited.
246332=Not a bird can be seen within like 5 km. Are we at the right place?
246333=Look at these traces! Someone just left. We'd better run a search carefully.
246334=Search around with the Radar as well. No more than 3 hours have passed since we received the signal. The sender must be around.
246335=I got something. The sender is in the north. 12 o'clock.
246336=Look. A fainted woman over there! And...oh, no! Some Zombies moving towards her.
246337=Oh... You attracted those brainless things towards this way. Good one, mate! Since when did you begin to do things smartly?
246338=Ahem... Ha-ha, "smart" is my middle name!
246339=I just got out of EdenCorp. Those people are like ten times scary than Zombies.
246340=Yup. No doubt about it. The thing is... Why they are after you?
246341=For my patent! I'm a breeding expert. EdenCorp wanted to have my breeding techs and I refused them. That's why they were trying to "solve the problem" in another way.
246342=Where did they hold you? Don't worry. We'll get you out of the trouble.
246343=Over there is the stronghold of EdenCorp. Get ready, fighters!
246344=Same plan. You and me, each taking a squad. One from the front. The other from the back. Let's move.
246345=Aha! A complete success! We smashed the headquarters of EdenCorp.
246346=Things are not that simple. Telling from the size, it was more of a temporary stronghold.
246347=Based on what EdenCorp usually does, they haven't got what they want if they let Elena live till today.
246348=Exactly. I put the lab log they want in a hidden place.
246349=If you don't mind, we can get it for you.
246350=This is where Elena left her log? Can there be more zombies?! How did she put it in?
246351=There might not be so many Zombies in the past. Anyway, clean them up first.
246352=That's it! Thank god, it's still good as new. I owe you much, guys!
246353=What's exactly in it? Sorry, I have to know the answer, cuz it has something to do with the lives of all of us.
246354=I understand. You're my life saviors, after all. This is the bio-genetic technology. Here you are.
246355=Bio-genetics... Continue the research, Elena. I believe it's gonna be of great use in the near future!
246356=Got another distress signal. Wait... It's from EdenCorp?!
246357=EdenCorp? My dear sniper, you did read the info accurately, didn't you?
246358=Let's check it out then. Isn't this what we've been expecting? Let's go!
246359=You sure someone's in there? It's only an abandoned warehouse.
246360=Shush... You hear that?
246361=Right behind the door. Looks like someone's locked inside.
246362=Let's get closer. Be careful.
246363=Thank you so much, guys! You were right. EdenCorp was the one who made the Zombie virus.
246364=Tell me. Why did they do this? What exactly do they want?
246365=Sorry. I wish I knew the answer. But I'm only an ordinary worker there. I don't know much about the scheme.
246366=But I heard that the one who initiated the project was Dr. Luke. Yet he was against what EdenCorp was doing and left it later.
246367=Dr. Luke? Where did he go?
246368=No idea. But I overheard earlier he had been held at a waste recycling station not long before he disappeared. You might find some clues there.
246369=Here we are. Dirty and smelly! Looks like it really is a waste recycling station.
246370=Yup. The smell alone is a no-no for me.
246371=Alright, guys. Not the time for complaining yet. Let's get down to business.
246372=From the intel we got at the waste recycling station, there should be a stronghold of EdenCorp somewhere around 20 km away. Natalie, I need more info on it.
246373=On it.
246374=What? This is the so-called stronghold? EdenCorp is short of money or what?
246375=Don't underestimate it. The defense here is pretty solid.
246376=Be careful with every move. Don't let them run away easily.
246377=From what we got so far, EdenCorp already knew where the notes were. We gotta take the notes before they do.
246378=Look at there! Ah... We're busted. EdenCorp is quicker than we are.
246379=They are here for the notes of Dr. Luke, too. Don't let them have the notes. Let's move!
246380=What we do now? The notes must have been taken away by EdenCorp.
246381=I don't think so. If EdenCorp got the notes, there will not be this many guards outside a useless stronghold. Obviously, they did not find it that easily.
246382=Make sense. What are we supposed to do?
246383=Simply wait for the right timing. With Bonnie, it'll be much easier to find the HQ of EdenCorp.
246384=The signal is from EdenCorp? You sure, Bonnie?
246385=100% sure. I was there for over six months.
246386=Alright, buds. Take your arms and go!
246387=This is the stronghold of EdenCorp? Don't you find it a little bit... creepy?
246388=Based on rough estimate, there're around twenty armed guards. We can take down them all.
246389=Great. Then surprise time!
246390=From what we found, EdenCorp is looking for a woman called Cara. Any idea who she could be?
246391=Cara? Never heard of the name.
246392=Found it! Cara was a farmer, and a former supplier for EdenCorp.
246393=Supplier? There must be something we don't know. We gotta find Cara before EdenCorp does!
246394=It should be here. I can see the guards of EdenCorp from the binoculars.
246395=So we attack now? My gun is thirsty for something juicy and red.
246396=I'm afraid you need to hold on a while. We're here to save Cara. First make sure whether she's safe.
246397=Natalie, come with me to get in. Rebecca, cover us.
246398=Th...thank you. They held me there for days to find where Dr. Luke is. Can't imagine how they're gonna torture me next.
246399=You know where he is?
246400=No. But I was the one who took care of him. He once gave me a notebook with his researches in it. The thing seems to be very important to EdenCorp.
246401=!!! Can we have the notes? Trust me, it's important for us.
246402=That's what the people from EdenCorp said. But I could tell they were not gonna do anything good with it, so I made up a lie. This time, I'll tell you where it is.
246403=Is this the place, Cara?
246404=Yup. But looks like someone's been here. Weird...
246405=I noticed that as well. That is to say...
246406=Let's look around first. Hope things are not that bad.
246407=Looks like EdenCorp already took away the notes. We're late again!
246408=They can't be far from here. Locate them with the Radar.
246409=Found their vehicles. 40 km away. 12 o'clock. Heading north at full speed.
246410=Let's go. Do not let them go this time!
246411=About 15 min ago, EdenCorp's vehicles entered the Facility.
246412=Attack now! Find the notes of Dr. Luke as quickly as you can!
246413=Now we know what's going on. EdenCorp was trying to control the world with the genetic agent "Eve." But what they actually made was the zombie virus.
246414=Worse still, they pretended to be innocent and lived with us like that in "castle."
246415=We shall not stand by. They must pay for what they did.
246416=Dr. Luke's notes say, the headquarters of Eden is at somewhere remote. The few of us are far from enough to handle them.
246417=Brady, do you mean...?
246418=We'll disclose the truth and let other survivors out there know. The Minutemen, Vindicators and Wildlings... Count them in for this ultimate battle!
246419=No one knows what's gonna happen next. But there's one thing we know for sure -- we are about to usher in a new era!
246420=Calm down. Their wounds are weird. Better check it out.
246421=I bet she can't hear it. What about one month's ration of Sizzling Gophers as the stake?
246422=Let's go, buds! After this, I'll buy you roasted Gophers, as much as you want!
246423=Copy that. I'll locate where it is as fast as possible.
246424=Wooo! It's gonna be the war to end all wars?
246425=Glad to know you feel that way, Mr. Brom. Welcome!
246426=Thanks, I am more concerned about what you need me to do. I used to be a mercenary.
246427=It's clear that one can't survive without some skills these days.
246428=There are still many secrets hidden here. We need people like you to explore them with us.
246429=I'll leave the trap here and go have a rest. Hope I could see a Gopher in the trap tomorrow morning.
246430=Now we have workers in the Mine. We'll be able to collect some Stones tomorrow. Now we may go have a rest.
246431=Place the Mushroom Box here and go get some sleep. We'll have enough food to eat tomorrow.
247001=Check out what I found! There's a garage right under the Entrance Hall!
247002=Looks like it'll need some repairs though.
247003=Consider it done!
247004=Heavens, what's that piled up over there?
247005=Visitor detected. Diagnostics mode activated.
247006=30%......57%......scan complete. Damage report: 23% of core energy remaining......low battery mode activated.
247007=It's a robot!
247008=N.A.T.E at your service. I can do tasks, such as gathering, distributing, storage, and many more.
247009=Last activation for service. 5000 hours ago. Service target......Error. Data lost.
247010=Don't worry buddy. This is your new home now. Welcome!
247011=Hard to believe such a small machine can carry that many supplies.
247012=Hear that N.A.T.E? The ever-so spiteful Emma is actually complimenting y—N.A.T.E!
247013=N.A.T.E! Oh no, it shut off! Poor buddy...
247014=Don't worry, it's just out of power. It'll be back up and running again when we find a way to power him up.
247015=I hope that day comes soon!
247016=Our Heroes are short of soldiers. Please replenish more.
247017=Facing the strong enemy, we need to ensure that each Hero leads at least one soldier.
247018=Replenish soldiers and get prepared.
247019=There're toxic gases and pollution everywhere. We'd better be careful with every step we take.
247020=Same strategy. We move towards Eden inch by inch.
247021=I got a file here. Perhaps we can find some clues in it.
247022=Looks like these are some survival experience left by someone.
247023=We need to capture a Lv. 1 city first. Then capture more territories and move towards Eden little by little.
247024=Maybe we can build some Facilities out of these minerals to shield us from the pollution, and keep our territory connected.
247025=Tap to view rules on other pages.
247026=Tap here to close the rule page
247027=After figuring out how to play, let's get started in the new season!
248001=I saw someone special at the door.
248002=Special? How special?
248003=With no gun, the guy blew a zombie's head off with bare fists.
248004=Check if he got other weapons. Then bring him to me.
248005=Hey, guys... Fernando? You're alive?! Thought you already turned into one of those things!
248006=You bastard, Beesly! Who do you think I am?
248007=You know him? Who is he, Fernando?
248008=An old villain. Messing around and scamming people everywhere.
248009=Heh. C'mon. I wasn't that bad. I used to be a boxing coach.
248010=Yep. Boxing coach! The one who ran away with all my money for "boxing lessons."
248011=Wait, did I? There must be something wrong. I'll give you back all your money and interests. I promise!
248012=Welcome, Laura. May I know what you did in the past for a living?
248013=I used to work for a logistics company. I also have a van. Glad to lend a hand if you need help.
248016=Which is to say, we can go back to the ground more often?
248017=Of course, Fernando.
248018=Thanks, Laura. We'll count on you to collect resources up there.
248019=Thank you for opening the door for me. You really saved my life.
248020=Don't be so modest. A couple of zombies like that ain't a problem for you. Are they, Ms. Sharpshooter?
248021=Do I know you?
248022=We're actually from the same area. Heard of your name years ago. After all, everyone knew we had a shooting champion.
248023=That's right, Pamela. I even have your autograph!
248024=Alright. But that was really a close one. I got only one bullet left.
248025=Haha. No need to worry about that here. Are you interested in being our coach for shooting?
248026=With pleasure.
248027=Voila. This is the Fortress. How do you think, Fiona?
248028=Not bad. The place's much better than the warehouse.
248029=Trust me. The longer you stay here, the more you'll like it.
248030=So, let's get down to business. What do you need from me?
248031=Alright. As you can see, we're expanding the place at the moment...
248032=Simply put, we need you to do what you did when training the Minutemen.
248033=Sure. But to be frank, my way of training is way beyond what is called "cruel."
248034=I see. You may adopt whatever training you want, so long as we have good fighters.
248035=Morning, guys!
248036=Geez! Where did she come from?
248037=Who are you?
248038=Forgot my voice already? We had a satellite call last night!
248039=That can't be real! You were like 20 km away when calling. We planned to rescue you early this morning.
248040=I would say I'm much stronger than you thought. As a fitness coach, I would never be dwarfed by half a marathon.
248041=On another note, you really gotta check out the security issue. No one saw me while I tried to get in.
248042=That's because zombies, generally speaking, cannot get over the wall.
248043=Tell me you don't really think zombie is your only enemy, sweetheart.
248044=Remember, in the post-apocalypse world, humans can be more dreadful than zombies.
248045=Well. The good news is, from today on, I'll help you work on the defense with what I can do.
248046=Brady, I'm fed up with Dr. Luke!!
248047=Dr. Luke? What's going on?
248048=What's going on? Look at all the mess here. Thanks to the great Dr. Luke!
248051=You know what? He said the pot was his invention. And almost poured the Gopher soup on me!
248053=Calm down, Emma. Perhaps the genius is supposed to be different from ordinary people in a way?
248054=What? You're "infected" by him or what? Or I'm the one who's gone mad?
248055=Heh, easy. I know he's kinda lunatic sometimes, but he did fix lots of things for us.
248056=Obviously, he's a genius. He only seemed to have been frightened by something.
248057=Trust me. Simply keep him in the Lab, and he'll bring us one miracle after another.
248058=Hey, look! Where did the statue in the Diner come from?
248059=Beware of where you touch, my friend. That's my work.
248060=Who are you?! I've never seen you before!
248061=No panic. This is my friend. He got here last night. You all went to bed at that time.
248062=Now let me introduce Pheidias to you. He's a sculptor.
248063=Sculptor? Can't believe there's still sculptor in such a doomed world.
248064=Do you mean we'll have many more statues like this in the Fortress?
248065=Of course not. I made it to study the texture of the Stones here.
248066=Texture of Stones? Sorry, I still don't get it. Why we need to know that?
248067=Pheidias is more than a sculptor. He knows mining and constructing well. You'll be surprised by how much he can do.
248068=Brady, good to see you again! Glad to know you're alive.
248069=So do I, man.
248070=Another old friend of you?
248071=Bingo! I was just about to introduce to you my old partner -- Pearson, the architect.
248072=I was the designer for the defense structure of the "castle." Sadly, it didn't survive the zombie wave.
248073=Now you have a good chance to stop living on with remorse. We do need a good architect here.
248074=Thanks, bud. I'll do my best. You have my words.
248075=Beesly is my old friend. He used to be a fight trainer and can teach you some self-defense skills.
248076=There is no such a word as "surrender" in my dictionary!
248077=I heard you want to learn how to beat an enemy. Let me teach you a thing or two. Don't panic. I'll be gentle.
248078=Welcome on board, Laura! I wonder if you'd mind lending the car to us for collecting suplies?
248079=No problem. Let me take care of this. Don't forget I'm an old driver!
248080=Welcome aboard, Pamela! I heard you were a shooting champion. Wanna become a shooting instructor?
248081=Happy to help! As long as there are enough bullets, I'll train everyone into a sharpshooter.
248082=Welcome aboard, Instructor Fiona. I'll be counting on you for future military training missions.
248083=Leave it to me! Only one problem - I hope my "ogrish training" doesn't scare people away.
248084=Welcome aboard, Miss Lori. I've heard you're a professional fitness instructor?
248085=Yes, life is about exercise and I will help y'all develop the most scientific workout plan.
248086=Welcome aboard, Dr. Luke, I'm sure you'll enjoy it here.
248087=Haha, of course! Separate labs, quiet surroundings... just perfect for research!
248088=Just wait and see! I'll turn this place into a technological fortress as long as giving me enough materials and time.
248089=Welcome aboard, Pheidias. May I ask what you are specialized in?
248090=My specialties are mining and building. Hope I can help!
248091=I've heard a lot about you, Pearson! We're still talking a lot about your building a community of the living.
248092=That's been a while ago! However, I think I can help if you need an architect here.

Worse still, there were few days when she was not beaten by him. The miserable childhood made her who she was, cold and inapproachable.\nBy the time the zombie virus broke out, Rebecca was only 5 years old. Too young to survive alone, she had to seek a shelter with her stepfather. After years of turmoil, she came across a crucial opportunity. In an unexpected siege by zombies, she was found and rescued by the Minutemen led by Benson. They brought her back to the "castle", a place where humans dwelt. To her amazement, her stepfather did something unusual at the critical moment -- he created an opportunity for the Minutemen to save Rebecca at the price of his own life. And so, he devoted the last few minutes of his life to the salvation of her daughter.\nAfter arriving at the "castle", Rebecca learnt how to shoot with the help of Benson. Her talent in shooting was rare but visible. That's why she was soon accepted as a member of the Minutemen. In a few years' time, Rebecca made it to become an outstanding sniper. With numerous contribution she made, she was promoted to Major at a young age. Impressed by her unparalleled skills and mysterious personality, everyone around her treated her with respect and admiration.\nOn the very day the "castle" fell, Rebecca was outside, leading her team on a mission. By the time she came back, the "castle" was already gone. Left with no other choice, Rebecca led the team to shift from one shelter to another, while searching for other people who got out of the "castle."

With their guidance and help, Diana began her journey in geology from an early age. When she was 16, the zombie crisis broke out. Luckily, Diana's family was under special protection from the government. After the government collapsed, they were escorted by the army to the dwelling of humans, the "castle." In the first few years, her parents were not treated well, for geology was considered useless in the doomsday and the management there was completely a mess. Forced to do all sorts of manual labor to make ends meet, they both died of illness within a few years.\nAfter that, as the resources were running low, the management finally realized that they had to expand their living space and began to look for experts in geology. That's when Diana was chosen as a geology consultant, responsible for the survey of underground resources and the excavation plan. With outstanding talent and years of study, Diana got her work done well with ease, earning a good salary with excellent performance. Later, she gained more respect and played an indispensable role there.\nHalf a month before the fall of the "castle", Diana was commissioned by the leader of the Minutemen, Benson, to help him study an ore of unknown origin. Before the results of the research could be obtained, the "castle" fell under the onslaught of the zombie wave. Diana escaped under the protection of the Minutemen. On the way out, she hid the ore in an office of EdenCorp she passed by to lessen the burden. In the end, she managed to get rid of the zombies, but somehow lost contact with the soldiers protecting her all the way.

When he was 2, the zombie crisis broke out. Both his parents were killed in the disaster. Jack was rescued by his uncle, Benson, leader of the Minutemen. He was then brought to the dwelling of humans, the "castle", where he was raised and cared for years. There, Jack received rigorous military training and got to know several members of the Minutemen. When he grew up, however, he chose to be a courier instead of following his uncle's arrangement to join the Minutemen.\nBefore the fall of "castle", Jack was accidentally involved in an issue, and nearly lost his life in it. It all started from the confidential intel stolen by Major Bolton of the Minutemen from EdenCorp. To keep it safe, he gave the intel to Jack without much explanation, and asked him to pass it to Benson. Not knowing how important the file was, Jack accidentally mixed the intel with other parcels. He thus became the target hunted by EdenCorp. With the skills and nimble mind he had developed during his years with the Minutemen, Jack made it to get back from the death's door several times. Unfortunately, the zombie wave broke through the defense of the Minutemen. And so the "castle" fell. Jack was not able to find Benson amid the chaos. Instead, he went all the way to the west with other survivors. Meanwhile, the hunt by EdenCorp never stopped for a second...

He had a failed marriage. His wife left him and took away his only daughter. Devastated and disheartened, Harrison has since devoted all his energy to his business and stayed single till now.\nIn 1992, the zombie crisis broke out. The 35 year old Harrison was driving to the city his ex-wife was in to deliver goods. At that time, a horde of zombies were flooding into the city. To protect his daughter, he drove to his ex-wife's house, only to find she and her current husband had already turned into zombies. He had no choice but to shoot them dead. The bad news was his daughter was missing. To find his daughter, Harrison made up his mind and rushed out onto the street. He found nothing and was unluckily caught in the middle of a horde of zombies. The moment he thought he was so dead, an army arrived in time and saved him. He followed the army all the way to the dwelling of humans, the "castle." Until then, he still could not find his daughter.\nTo search for his daughter, Harrison volunteered to join the Minutemen. Due to the irreversible damage caused by his previous injury, he failed to pass the physical test. In the end, he had to take up his old job -- farming. Later, he became a major supplier, and established partnership with the top business there -- EdenCorp. Harrison did not give up the hope to find his daughter. He told the Minutemen the basic info about his daughter and asked them for help when they went out on rescue missions. Although he knew there was little hope, he never gave up. Every now and then, he would go to the headquarters of the Minutemen to ask if there was any news about her.\nHis action, however, was misinterpreted by EdenCorp. Due to an info theft incident recently, it began a screening of partners. Harrison, as a supplier to the company, was listed as a major suspect for having private connections with the Minutemen. The poor Harrison was not aware of it at all. When the "castle" fell, Harrison escaped amid the chaos and hid in a warehouse. He found some communications equipment in there. Without hesitation, he contacted EdenCorp and decided to ask them for help...

Under the influence of her family, she became a famous pharmacist at a young age. At the wake of the zombie crisis, the governments of all countries were trying to find a miracle cure to the zombie virus. As an expert in medicine, Lafite was invited by the government to do relevant researches. As a result, among many experts, she was the only one who developed the medicine to slow down the transformation process of the infected. Because of the great achievement, the government rewarded her and gave her special protection. After the government collapsed, a special force that protected her escorted her to the dwelling of humans, the "castle."\nLater, most people were convinced that there's no cure to the zombie virus. Lafite also gave up her research and began growing herbs, to heal the residents and cope with the drug shortage issue. She reaped a lot of wealth from the business and gained popularity among residents. Even the top business EdenCorp approached her, offering her a high price to develop a new drug. Lafite agreed instantly and began working on it soon.\nDuring this period, however, she found that the material provided by EdenCorp contained a special element, which was extremely similar to the zombie virus she once studied. She was taken aback by the finding. She then realized she was in a big trouble. After thinking it over, she decided not to tell anyone about the issue. Yet, she tried to delay the development of the drug. Every time she handled the results to EdenCorp, she would claim the research was still ongoing. She thought this would keep EdenCorp from taking notice. Just then, a wave of zombies overwhelmed the "castle" overnight. And so Lafite was trapped in the plantation without any preparation.

From a young age, his dream was to become a movie star and he made his way to the US at the age of 20 to realize his dream in Hollywood. However, without the support of his family, he quickly found himself to be completely broke and had no choice but to work as a plumber to get by. This did not stop him as he continued to look for opportunities at the filming studios during his free time. Though he was unsuccessful in gaining the favor of any directors, he was still able to land roles as a background artist on several occasions.\nA few years later, the first zombie viruses struck. People haven't realized the severity of it due to it being in the preliminary stages. The media, on the other hand, made a big deal out of it and as a result, zombie movies became a popular genre. Mario landed a role in one of the zombie movies as the leader of a team of survivors. Unfortunately, on the day of the shoot, someone really did turn into a zombie at the studio and the filming venue fell into chaos almost immediately. Mario was lucky and made it out safely, he arrived at the streets outside to find more and more zombies and masses of people running for their lives. In the midst of chaos, he joins a team of survivors and miraculously continued to "play" his role as the leader of the team. He displayed astounding reasoning and reliability which earned the respect of the others and became a recognized leader. Under Mario's leadership, they first secured a number of firearms in the nearby police station, then they proceeded to the supermarket to scavenge for food and essential supplies. After the critical items have been secured, they began an escape on foot that went on for several months. Their journey was filled with danger and members continued to fall. They faced numerous dire situations, but Mario still managed to lead the team through the challenges and successfully reached "Castle," a human society. Only then, did Mario free himself of his "role" and discard his courage and confidence as he behaved like a complete coward at the praise and invitation of the society executives and the Minuteman.\nAfterwards, Mario continued his old trade of being a plumber and hid away his dream of becoming a movie star in the face of the arrival of the apocalypse. It remained the same way as many years passed by, until one day, as Mario was fixing the sewage pipes for Eden Corp., the largest corporation in the community, he heard a loud bang from the outside. The familiar sound of zombies roaring and people screaming filled his ears. He peeked through the crack in the pipes to see the one scene he never wished to see again. After twenty years of safety and peace, the society of the living was finally overrun by the zombies! However, this time Mario no longer possesses the courage nor the script to face the zombies once again and all he could do was to curl up helplessly in the darkness of the dark sewers...

At the age of 5, her parents were hired by the top financial group Eden Corp. and their entire family moved to the United States. Just as they arrived, the zombie havoc exploded before they could make it out of the airport. Elena's parents both sacrificed themselves to protect her and she was rescued by an airport security personnel named Coleman. After a few twists and turns of events, she found herself in "Castle," society of the living, and grew up under Coleman's care.\nGrowing up, Elena displayed a strong interest and talent towards breeding animals. She found a job being a breeder and became a professional breeder without any guidance. Eden Corp. was interested in her ability and extended numerous invitations to Elena. Unfortunately, these invitations were all rejected because seeing Eden Corp. reminds Elena of their tragic deaths.\nHowever, this did not mean the end to Eden Corp's efforts. They secretly sent agents to kidnap Elena and shipped her out of the society of the living and locked her up in one of their facilities in the outside world. They forced Elena to work for them, there was no way for her to retaliate so she had no choice but to comply, but little did she know, what they wanted her to breed were no ordinary animals, they were zombies locked up in a laboratory! Elena was shocked, but there were no other options. All she could do was to overcome her fear and the grotesque zombies to continue with her work.\nThe hellish life continued for an unknown period of time before Elena woke up from a nightmare one day to find a paper note next to her. The note included a detailed escape route and the guard shift rotation schedules, there was also a key next to the note. Though the origins of these two items are unknown, Elena's had enough of the life here and decided to give it a shot, because this might be the only chance she'll ever get.

The zombie virus spread when she was only 7 years old. Following the instructions of the orphanage staff, Bonnie and her companions attempt to escape the chaos. However, people continued to die or turn during their escape and Bonnie was the only one who survived in the end. Luckily, in the face of despair, Bonnie encountered biologist Dr. Helen. With Helen's expertise in biology and her specialization in researching the zombie virus, they received special treatment in the society of the living—a rescue team of twenty fully-armed personnel was sent to escort the two to "Castle," the society of the living and their post-apocalyptic life turns to a new chapter.\nAfter settling in in "Castle," Bonnie was adopted by Helen and began her learning of biology. After growing up, Bonnie received a job offer from Eden Corp. with her outstanding scores and became an employee of the largest corporation in the living society. Bonnie had it all, everything was nothing but smooth sails in the first few years, but she slowly began to notice that there was more to the corporation than what's on the surface. The deeper she became involved with Eden Corp., the more she suspected them of hiding some kind of large secret. Just as her suspicions continued, Coleman, a member of the Minuteman, the largest military force in the society of the living, and the rescue team captain that led the team who escorted Bonnie and Helen to the society of the living had found her to ask her to assist in investigating Eden Corp. Due to the relationship the two continued after the rescue, Coleman kept no secrets and told Bonnie that the Volunteer Army suspects that Eden Corp. has something to do with the zombie catastrophe and that they're continuing some kind of extremely classified operation in secret. Everything Coleman said matched Bonnie's suspicion of Eden Corp., so she agreed to help him and became a spy of the Minuteman in Eden Corp.

In the doomsday, the manor where her family had lived for generations became a sought-after place; Cara had to learn how to disguise herself in the face of thugs who invaded the manor, and trade information in exchange for the protection of the major forces.\nOver the past two decades, under Cara's painstaking management, the manor, which seemed to be running a regular fruits and vegetables business, developed into a huge and complete intelligence network, which thus became the target of the four major forces. Cara knew that the secrets in her hands were like a sword of Damocles hanging over her head, which would eventually fall sooner or later.

On the day of her 16th birthday, Chihiro waited passionately till the sunset for her parents' return, only to receive news of their death by zombies. Soon after, the once genial kinfolks showed their true colors. Chihiro and his brother barely made it to the underground Fortress among all the power-grabbing inside the family who sent deadly pursuit on them. Chihiro lost her warming smile ever since. The cheerful little girl was no longer there. So cold and indifferent she became, she no longer put faith in other people.\nLife in the Fortress was not easy for a girl with no other support. Her brother Ogawa was the only reason she pulled through, the only person who gave her strength and courage. He taught Chihiro the art of swords and lifted her to become one of the best swordstresses. The sword Murasame left by her mother granted her the resolution to kill and for revenge, though the latter defines her more cruel swordsmanship over the years.\nFor that matter, arguments broke out several times between the siblings. Ultimately, Chihiro promised to take her revenge within two years before returning and starting a new life with his brother.\nYet, everything changed when Chihiro finally returned with victory.

251012="Distribution panel, checked. Switch, checked. Powering up..." It's always the same. The tedious procedure had burned its mark on my muscle memory. I'm pretty sure I can turn on this noisy beast in my sleep. The man in charge might disagree, though. It's the most precious treasure to him, after all. \nA machine that can generate electricity is nothing less than a gold mine in a post-apocalyptic world, wouldn't you agree? As for us? We are just a bunch of slackers who need to rest and be fed. At least, that's what the foreman calls us. "I'll replace you useless shit with Machines, sooner or later!" he shouted, as usual, but I knew he wouldn't do so, for a cheapskate like him paying us with leftovers won't spend an extra coin on expensive machines. \n"This is all we do! Checking and repairing! I can't tell if I'm alive or working in this stupid power plant called hell!" I vented my anger on the machine next to me. \n"Stop complaining, Fernando. Look on the bright side. At least we still have a job. A lot more people..." \n"... A lot more people out there live in slums and only have grass to eat! I know, Maurer! That's all you ever said. But you know what? Sometimes I feel like I'm just a breathing gear stuck in a giant machine!" \n"... Come on. Stop thinking about it. You'll only make it worse. Let's talk about something else. Zeus has sent their new expert. Look, it's her." Maurer pointed to the door when the expert walked in. The foreman unctuously stood next to her, livid at us as usual. \n"I just hope she is not here to finish what the foreman started... Though... she's kinda...pretty." As the expert approached, I saw her face more clearly. That gorgeous face rooted me to the spot where I stood, and I could hear my heart beating. Only after a long time did I realize that was the feeling of falling in love. \n"Hello, are you Fernando, the chief electrician? I'm Bonnie, the resource consultant. Nice to meet you!" \nBonnie entering my dull life changed everything. She was always optimistic and cheerful with her warming smile. All her beautiful traits reminded me of what humans had once been before the world ended. Yet, good things never last. The old faulty power generator eventually gave out, causing explosions everywhere. In the fire, the foreman ordered us to repair the machine. I prayed for Bonnie's safety, only to find her name among other missing victims. That was the moment my world collapsed. \n"Fuck the apocalypse! Human lives are nothing compared to resources?!" I'd had enough of this bullshit. \n"Are sure you about this, Fernando? You won't survive outside the community." The reviewer asked me with a disdainful look on his face. Before the fire, Bonnie's words still lingered in my head, "Don't ever underestimate yourself, Fernando. You are so much more than you think you are." \nI spat at the doorman and shouted contemptuously, "Keep dragging your ass for this pathetic community! I'll find someplace better. I'm a genius, after all!"
251013=Chased down by a stout man, Natalie clutched tightly the two slices of black bread she had stolen, panting heavily. \n"You little brat, stealing my stuff! I'll teach you a lesson!" \nNatalie checked her cry as the man rained down his fists on her little body, stuffing into her mouth the tasteless food she just stole, the only thing she had eaten over the last week. To her, the pain inflicted on her body was nothing compared to her dying stomach. That's how Natalie survived the last seven years. Without the strength and skills of an adult, she could only resort to stealing food while enduring all the curses and beatings. \n"Stop it, Bacchus!" An unfamiliar voice broke out, interrupting the abusive routine for the first time. \n"Prof... Professor Gallo." Noticing it was from the community's prominent Professor Gallo, Bacchus immediately put on his other face and explained, "I'm the victim here. This is the third time this month! It's not like I'm running a charity! Surely you understand how hard to make a living these days, Professor Gallo." \nIt was barely convincing for the mining magnate, who constantly deprived workers of food and delayed their payments, to complain about hardship at the time. Everyone in the community knows Bacchus has the Vindicators backing him for his wrongdoing. Professor Gallo kept quiet and signed to his wife to pick Natalie up. \n"Little girl, what is your name? Where are your parents?" asked Mrs. Gallo while wiping the dust from Natalie's face with a handkerchief. That's when Bacchus realized the little brat he called was actually a girl. \n"......" \n"Madame, this child must be mute. I never heard her utter a word." \nPreoccupied with her hard-won food, Natalie engulfed the bread as they talked. When she regained her strength to clear the blurry images in her eyes, she realized Mrs. Gallo was still there, squatting next to her, tenderly smiling at her. Feeling encouraged, Natalie stuttered out the name she had never been called, the one she had learned from the main character in a tattered book. \n"Natalie... has no parents." \n"Well, would you let us be your parents, then?" Catching the faltering look on Natalie's face, Mrs. Gallo softened her voice, "We can't have children of our own, and I've always wanted to adopt a strong girl like you. Natalie, are you willing to be our daughter? We'll try our best to give you a lovely home." \nNatalie was dumbfounded, as if she was digesting the meaning of the words she had just heard, when Bacchus got impatient and gave her a push, "Are you seriously considering this?! Professor Gallo will be the one developing a vaccine. Do you know how many people are begging to stay by his side? Being adopted by them is a shortcut to happily ever after!" \nA seven-year-old Natalie had no idea what happily ever after meant, much less a vaccine. However, the word "home" appealed to her. Would a home be like that she read in a storybook, warm and with plenty of food and loving parents? Thinking about that, Natalie cast a hopeful glance and nodded vigorously, \n"Yes, I am!"

251022=Genial and responsible in heart, sheriff Brady is the most reliable person in the Everest community. Whether to lead against zombies or to lend a hand to the weak and elderly, he never turns down his urge to be patient and helpful.\nTo him, being the sheriff comes with heavy responsibility. The badge on his chest is more than just a symbol. It represents the trust of the people whose lives he swears to protect. Yet as devoted as he is, it was his family he failed to keep the promise to.\nAfter Brady's parents sacrificed themselves for him and his sister to have a future, he gave up his music dream and drove himself into becoming a sheriff, who mastered killing methods to keep his unhearing sister from harm.\nHowever, god never took pity on the miserable. One day, unprecedented swarms of zombies broke through the community's defense, rendering the safe haven a waking nightmare.\n"Faster, faster!"\nBrady's usual self-possession was ridden with panic. Having backtracked anxiously through the fleeing crowd, he kicked open a door and fired three shots at the zombie pouncing on his sister, only to freeze when he saw the purplish-black wounds on her.\n"Damn it! Damn it! ...No! Please don't do this to me, Jane! I can't!"\nAs her sister signed, begging Brady to kill her, Brady cursed himself with the foulest words he could think of. He couldn't do it when that was his sister he had sworn to protect.\n[Brad... I—don't want to—to end up like—mom and dad...]\nBrady's sister signed with stiff fingers, reminding him of the hellish nightmare that took their parents from them. Dying as the monster she hated was the last thing he wanted for his sister, so he numbed his grieving heart and pulled the trigger, ending the life of his last family member.\nAfter the zombie rush spent itself, mangled bodies and desperate cries filled the ruined street. Brady picked up his sister's body and disappeared into the crowd. The badge he held dear, crushed by the stampeding crowd, was left behind.
251023=Young Emma's memory of her mother comes mainly from the news broadcast at night. As a front-line reporter, her mother was always there facing the camera in a professional suit with sharp eyes and a coherent voice reporting the latest situation on the front line.\nThe photographs taken during those interviews were the window for young Emma to learn about the world. From the mysterious primitive forest to the war-torn battlefield, from the backwater village to the bustling city, Emma pieced the world together from her mother's photos, inspiring her to become a journalist.\nAfter graduation, Emma became an excellent journalist, just as she always wanted. Her photographs and reports induced sympathy with facts, exposing society by focusing on ordinary people's lives outshined by the fast-growing world.\nSadly, the sudden zombie outbreak ended Emma's rising career. After rejecting Zeus Group's intention to propagandize their vaccine, Emma got canceled as a journalist. She had no choice but to return to her father's shelter and earn a living working in the community canteen. However, the worst was yet to come.\nHer father became sensitive and overly paranoid since her mother went missing during a zombie attack. His idea of a safe zone took a drastic turn from the community to only the house they lived in. One day, he even locked Emma in her confined room in fear of losing her.\nEmma, a young girl with a wanderlust spirit, could not accept such a life. She would rather struggle to survive in the ruined world than live nonchalantly under the twisted protection of her father. The tension between father and daughter was building up high until the last straw eventually broke the camel's back.\n"If you leave this place, no one will protect you. Zombies will feast on your head. Bandits will take what's left of you. You'll live a miserable life! And for what? Freedom?!"\nEvery time Emma tried to go out, her father would describe the horrors of surviving alone in the doomsday. Emma knew very well the risk, yet it was still not a good enough reason for her to come to terms with being imprisoned for the rest of her life, so that time, she gave her father a picture of her mother smiling happily on the job.\n"When mother was on the most dangerous front line doing her job, did you consider she reckless and stupid?"\n"I don't think so. You were always proud of her, saying she was doing honest and righteous work."\n"...I wish I had done things differently." As if suddenly deflated, Emma's father bent his sturdy back while his eyes turned red from anger or maybe sadness. After a long while, he uttered a muffled voice.\n"Had she not pursued this dangerous job, our family would have lived happily in the community. And now, she's gone missing, and everyone knows what that means. I won't let you follow in your mother's footsteps!"\n"The world deserves to know the truth! If anyone can finish what mother started, it's me!" Unlike her father, who accepted the death of his wife, Emma believed that her mother was still alive and waiting for her. She assured her father.\n"Father, I'll return with news of mother. I promise you."

The fact was Lemuros received the lowest pay after completing the largest amount of work. One day, Lemuros was dispatched to help geologist Diana with her mineral investigation. He had a crush on Diana the first time he saw the gentle and lovely lady. He thus decided to buy her a decent gift and express his feelings for her. That's when he realized he was making much less money than others.

251028=Matthew was originally an ordinary man in the community. He was weak and timid. He had to work around the clock to make ends meet. Despite the tough life, he still had a strong passion for life. Although he could only earn half a loaf of bread with half a day's work, he would still share it with those homeless children he ran into on a stormy midnight. \nIn the chaotic apocalyptic age, compassion did not worth a penny. Timid Matthew soon became the one bullied by others. He was often punched and kicked, and even robbed by those bullies. The pain all over his body made Matthew realize that no other people would help the ones suffering from poverty and hunger as he did. \n"Fight or get bullied." \nThe next time the punks tried to cut his hair in a gutter, Matthew clenched his fists. \n"The more I appear to be afraid of them, the more troubles they'll provoke." \nHe gritted his teeth when the money he earned with a day's work was taken away by the punks brandishing wolfsbane. \n"Good men were bullied yet the villains were not punished." \nThe day his supplies were taken away by a child he once helped on that stormy night, Matthew finally gave up all his innocent hopes. \nHe then decided to join the Vindicators. He changed into a fancy haircut and painted a terrifying mask on his face with colored paint. He even began to bully the weak. When he hit an enemy with his crowbar, saw his splashing blood, and heard his screaming, Matthew felt that a part of him was gone. \nYet Matthew was happy to see the loot he got. He ran away while laughing despite the pursuit of the vigilantes behind him. That day, he also ran away from his past when he was somewhat timid but was willing to share food with the children.
251029="Sir! The number of zombies in the northwest of our community exceeded the alarm level! We are all at your order." \nOn receiving the report from the soldier, McKinley was leaning back in his chair with his legs crossed, checking the warrant officer's badge he had just received. In contrast to the anxiety of the soldier, he shook off the cigarette ash and then rose to his feet slowly: \n"I see. Just a couple of zombies, right? No need to worry." \n"But the radar indicated that the zombies are closing in faster than usual. Do we need to ask for some reinforcement, Sir?" The soldier suggested hesitantly. \nWith his multiple victories and recent promotion in rank, McKinley was quite confident about his judgment. He interrupted the soldier's report and gave his order:\n"The zombies must be attracted by someone who went out to search for resources without permission! I received such reports every single month! Stop worrying over such trivial things. Be a real soldier, okay? I'll get rid of a bunch of those brainless things with one shot! Now tell our men to gather in ten minutes. We'll finish off this zombie horde." \n"Yes, Sir!" \nThe troops soon assembled in front of the gate of the community in a well-organized way. McKinley boasted his merits and victories again in front of the residents, and promised that he would bring all the soldiers back after this victory. As the soldiers arrived at the site, however, they were all stunned by the colossal being they saw. There was a Mutated Zombie which was several meters tall and had blackish and purplish skin. They started to shoot at the zombie, yet the bullets did not slow down its movement, but made it turn violent. It roared while dashing towards the soldiers. The neat defensive formation was instantly destroyed. \nMcKinley who had disdained to take the advice of the soldier now knew he made a fatal mistake. And the price was the death of the fellow soldiers who fought alongside him for years. He shouted at the troops, ordering everyone to retreat. But sadly, he could not change a thing. \n"Sir, run!" \nThe last soldier used his body to shield McKinley from a zombie and push him into the vehicle. He dared not look at the corpses for one more second. And so the young warrant officer became a shameful deserter he once hated the most.
251030=Due to Brom's perilous career as a mercenary, his wife had to lead an unsettled life with him for years. With the birth of their daughter, however, Brom finally decided to "retire." The only thing he couldn't let go of was the group of lads he trained in his mercenary team. Meanwhile, these energetic young men were eager to show Brom what they could do to impress him.\n"Boss, let us do this escort mission alone this time! Your wife just gave birth; you do need to stay here to take care of her," said one of the young mercenaries, while stroking the pinky face of the baby in Brom's arm. Judging from his resolute tone, the young man was quite confident about their ability.\n"By the way, the little princess is almost three months old! Haven't you decided her name yet, boss? We can't keep calling her 'baby girl' all the time, right?"\n"None of your business, okay? Her name was already decided," Brom replied. Worried that the baby would be aroused by the young man, Brom pushed him aside and placed the sleeping baby back in the crib in a clumsy yet gentle manner. Then, he grabbed the young man by the ear and dragged him out of the room before raising his voice, \n"Do the escort mission alone? You think it's an easy thing, don't ya? Let me tell you, the stuff is going to Vindicators' base. The least predictable lunatics in the wasteland! If you guys can really complete the mission without my help, maybe I'll consider handing the mercenary team to you."\nUpon hearing Brom's words, the young man, who was joking around moments ago, suddenly put on a serious look. He saluted Brom in a not-so-standard gesture and answered firmly, \n"Copy that. We'll make sure the mission is completed well!"\nIn fact, these carefree young men grew faster than Brom had expected. On the day of the mission, they easily infiltrated the Vindicators' base in disguise and handed the stuff to their contact. The mission was accomplished perfectly, after which Brom and the young men came back together. Looking at the lads chatting happily and mocking each other for the flaws in their disguise, Brom had a rare smile of relief on his face. He was now assured that it was time to start his leisure life with his wife and daughter, and these young men...would definitely create a better future for fellow mercenaries.\nWhat Brom did not expect, however, was the horrible scene he saw when they got closer to their base. Rows of houses fell down, with many objects burnt. Brom suddenly realized the seemingly simple escort mission was a trap to lure them away. He immediately rushed into the house, only to find his wife lying in a pool of blood, clinging tightly to the key to the secret room. To prevent the enemies from knowing the existence of the secret room, she left her daughter in the secret room alone and went out to distract the enemies.\n"Our dau-daughter...is in the...secret room... Go! Find her...and...leave the place..." With her last ounce of strength, his wife handed him the key, "Promise me...keep Doris safe..."\nDoris, the name that they decided to unveil after they settled in their new home, now became her last words.\nBrom could barely contain his rage right now. In his eyes was the determination to slay the enemy. To protect his little girl from being retaliated, Brom quickly came up with a plan - the Minutemen. The next day, he left her daughter on the road that the Minutemen would pass by every day. He then hid himself in a bush and waited until he saw Captain Bolton who was shocked to see the baby pick her up. He knew the Minutemen would be a better protector for Doris. He then swore to seek the enemies that killed his wife and complete the revenge with the rest of his life.\n"I'm not a good husband; nor am I a good father. But I swear I'll make sure Doris grows up safe and sound."
251031="Get lost, you stinking thing!" the owner shoved Barron out of the restaurant. Pointing at the rice crumbs on Barron's lips, the owner shouted at him, "Can't you stop eating for five minutes? You haven't done a thing I told you to do. Do you think I'm kind enough to offer free lunches to lazy bones? Be gone, idiot!"\n"Sorry... but I did my work..." Faced with the owner's insults, Barron did not show a slight trace of anger. Rubbing his round belly, he replied hesitantly in a low voice, "I was just hungry... I promise I'll start working right after filling up my stomach!"\n"Hungry? You ate an entire barrel of food! That's the ration of three days for a normal man! You've said "hungry" dozens of times today. I don't want to hear the word anymore, you freak!" The owner tossed the empty food container in front of Barron furiously. Initially, he thought Barron was but a dumb guy with great force. He never expected how big a stomach Barron got. He threw Barron's luggage out and slammed the door.\n"But...Ouch!" Barron, who wasn't quite articulate, failed to convince the owner and was hit by the door in the face. Once again, he was "dumped" by another boss. He roamed on the street and somehow walked into a filthy alley. He almost stumbled upon a box as he could barely "watch" his footsteps because of his round belly. Not long after, his stomach began to rumble loudly.\n"My stomach... Barron is hungry..." \nWhile muttering to himself, Barron's noticed the leftover food in a dumpster ahead. It was a mix of food scraps that had been there for who knows how many days. The awful rotten smell could not even turn on the appetite of rats. But Barron didn't care about it. The painful memory of hunger and nausea made eating an instinctive reflex for him. As long as it could alleviate his hunger, Barron would eat anything. And so, he approached the dumpster and stuffed everything he could grab into his mouth, without trying to tell what exactly he was eating.\n"Oh, my goodness! What is he eating?" A passerby exclaimed in fear. Barron paused for a second and turned his head toward the man, with a mouthful of flesh in his mouth. The next second, the man screamed, "That...that's a human arm, geez!! The freak is eating human flesh! Help! Help!! I saw a cannibal!"\n"No, Barron is just having a meal," Barron tried to explain, but the remains on his lips explained everything. In a community where the humane side did not perish yet, eating the flesh of one's own kind was no doubt a red flag. Driven away by the guards, Barron had to leave the community.\n"Why did they ask Barron to leave? Barron didn't do anything wrong. Barron was just hungry." Unable to tell the difference between human and animal flesh, Barron couldn't understand why they treated him that way.\nDue to unbearable hunger, he kept walking in the hope of finding another dumpster. Soon, the bodies surrounded by a few zombies drew his attention. On seeing his "food", Barron knocked down the zombies with his bare fists in a minute. Just as he was about to enjoy his "feast," a mysterious man came to him and passed him a loaf of bread that Barron hadn't seen in years.\n"Are you saying I can get food as long as I do as you say and kill someone?" Barron thought about the "deal" for a couple of seconds and nodded, "Sure, as long as I get food to eat, I'll help you take revenge."
251032=One day, Kin Ogawa, who was looking for ores to enhance his sword, arrived at a refugee shelter. The refugees, dressed in rags, huddled in small groups next to damaged walls. They were also holding their breath, because several zombies were pacing around not far away. \nBy the time Kin arrived, these survivors had run out of food and were on the verge of starvation. Despite the tough situation, none of them dared to break out and seek help. The group of zombies in the distance were of a smaller size in number. Still, they chose to stay in the ruins rather than fight for a way out. Cowardice was their biggest enemy. As most of them were about to starve to death, Kin, who came here to look for ores, gave them a gleam of hope. \n"Look! Someone's here! He's one of the Wildlings. Save us, sir!" The group of people who were lying in the corner "miraculously" gained strength and crawled to Kin. They dragged Kin's trousers, begging him to take them away. \n"The nearest human community is right there in the east. Only three kilometers away." Kin stepped back and shook off the "welcoming" hands. He then put back his tilted hat and raised one hand, showing them the direction of the community. \n"We know where the community is. But you see there are so many zombies ahead. As a member of the Wildlings, it's reasonable for you to escort us there, isn't it?" Said one refugee, with many more nodding at him to show approval. \n"Exactly. The Wildlings shouldn't be so ruthless." \n"It's your duty to help the weak like us!" \n
"......" Kin was caught speechless by the rude "request." He looked at this group of people who waited for others to "help" them, who reminded him of the zombies who lost their dignity with nothing left but a human-like appearance. \nWith a clinging sound, he pulled out his sword to warn the refugees. Finally, they stopped dragging him.\n"Sorry. I'm afraid I can't help you." Kin said as he threw a short knife on the ground: "Grab the weapon and protect yourself, guys. With arms and legs, you are not in need of any help from Wildlings." \n"I'm heading to the human community right now and will get rid of the zombies on the way. Those who want to leave, take the weapon and follow me; those who want to live with the fear of the so-called "danger", stay here and wait for the miracle to happen." \nAfter finishing his words, Kin turned around and left. The refugees began to protest behind him in a loud voice, "accusing" Kin of his ruthless attitude. When they realized that Kin was not waiting for them, they panicked. \n"Heh, gentleman. Please, please wait... Uhh... Be gone, disgusting zombies!" They then stood up and picked up the knife, running towards Kin as fast as they could. It turned out that fighting a zombie head-on was much more terrifying than running away from them. But when a man finally held the knife and aimed at the zombies, something inside him seemed to have changed out of a sudden. \n"Wait. I want to thank you for your words." The man who slayed a zombie on his own for the first time ran to Kin. \n"What do you mean? I didn't do anything." \n"No, you made me realize that it's always better to save myself than wait for someone else to save me."
251033=Harman was born in the Tribe of Sand, one of the most powerful tribes in the wasteland. People there were all remarkable weapon makers who could craft weapons that could be used to either fight off invaders or protect their fellow residents. The chief of the Tribe of Sand was in an old age. That's why on the day of the annual celebration, he announced the rules for the election of the next chief. The candidates needed to hunt down the mutated zombies outside the tribe and Harman was one of the candidates. \nDue to his dull and overly righteous personality, he did not have the support of many people. Harman did not care much about what others thought as a matter of fact. He went out alone for the zombie hunt. By the time he saw a mutated zombie following the trail left by it, someone was already fighting it alone. In the face of a zombie twice as tall as a human, even a strong warrior would be dwarfed. The weapon in his hand appeared to be a children's toy, which could barely leave a scratch on the thick skin of the zombie. \nAt this moment, the zombie was trying to throw the warrior into the air with its long arm; its sharp claws were about to tear the warrior's chest apart. Harman wasted no time and threw his weapon at the zombie to stop it. \n"Thank goodness... I'm still alive!" exclaimed the warrior. "Thank you so much, uhh...Mr...?" \n"Call me Harman." \n"Oh, Harman! I don't know how to thank you! If it weren't for you, I would have died ten seconds ago." The warrior was obviously embarrassed by the fact that he didn't even know the name of his savior. He then tried to start another topic: "I never expected someone would stand out and save me in the middle of such a vital competition. The candidates were all fighting for themselves and wished that more competitors could be "eliminated" here." \nOn hearing the statement, Harman showed a shocked face. He could not understand why a warrior would refuse to save his fellow warriors from the same tribe. He answered in a sincere tone: "Lives always come before the competition." \nThis was also what the chief often said. It was the first time someone mentioned it in a decisive competition. The young warrior was dumbfounded. He forced out a smile and proposed tentatively: "Well...then why don't we work together to get rid of the big fella first?" \n"Sure." \nHarman held up his weapon and headed toward the giant zombie. Under Harman's cover, the young warrior was able to get closer to the zombie and launched a few deadly cannonballs. Together, they managed to blow the head off the zombie. \n"Good job, dude! You know what? This is the first time I got a partner in the zombie hunt! And...it feels great!! But who should get the credit for this zombie?" \n"Half for you 'n half for me, I guess. Alright, time to look for the next prey." \n"Okay, fair enough. Let's see who could hunt more zombies in the end." The two competitors headed in opposite directions after a quick fist bump.
251034=Born into a family of soldiers, Bolton was a scrupulous and upright man. He had been fighting on the front line for years, turning from a rookie into a general. He gained outstanding merit in battles. In the wake of the zombie crisis, however, Bolton's once-promising career path met the Waterloo. The numb zombies that did not know what pain was kept spreading a contagious virus. Cities fell one after another. Bolton's army had to retreat all the way to a suburban town, where they tried their best to safeguard the remaining survivors.\nDays later, they managed to drive away the zombie horde. As everyone was celebrating the hard-won victory, Bolton received an urgent report from the front line, saying that an even larger zombie horde, composed of over a thousand zombies, was heading towards the town. They were estimated to arrive by the night of the next day. In the previous battle, Bolton's army had suffered heavy casualties fighting against hundreds of zombies. Now they had to face an enemy ten times the size of the previous one. This was undoubtedly devastating for a small town with about a hundred guards only. Even Bolton, who had fought and won many battles could not come up with a feasible tactic. At the critical moment, He received a letter from his father. The former commander-in-chief presented him with another option. \n"Bolton, the zombie horde will arrive at the city of X tonight. Leave the place now with the escorting army." \n"Leave? Are you asking me to be a deserter?!" Out there were the people whose lives were in danger. If a soldier like him chose to run away, how could others have faith to live on? He would rather die among the zombies than act as a deserter. \nHe tore up the letter in rage and turned around to go back to his command room. Two soldiers who were supposed to escort Bolton in the retreat stood before him. \n"What do you think you are doin'? Disobey my order? Get out of my way!" \n"Sorry, sir. We cannot disobey the commander-in-chief either. Please come with us." \n"Fine. You either let me stay here, or kill me now."\n"Sir, please come with us. You've already done too much. You've been staying here protecting those useless survivors for three months. In such an apocalypse, the old social order has long gone. No one will blame you for leaving at such a time."\nAnother soldier nodded, "Yes, many armies were disbanded these days. It's hard to stay alive, let alone take care of others."\nMore soldiers who had already decided to retreat began to persuade Bolton to leave. If they left now, at least they could stay alive. They stood little chance of beating the zombie horde even if they stayed there any longer.\n"If we disband like others do, there will be not a single army left." Regardless of the persuasion, Bolton made up his mind and came up with an idea, a bold but resolute one: "If the old order perished in the apocalyptic age, I'll create a new one then. We need at least one organization where people can protect each other with one mind!" \n"Yes! I'll create an organization with the power of solidarity!" said young Bolton in a resolute voice. Little did he know that it was this idea that led to the creation of a powerful organization that completely changed the political landscape of the apocalyptic world.
251035="Enrique, what are you doing? Lucky is dead! Just let me bury her." \nNatalie ran over to stop Enrique, who was holding a knife and trying to do something to the poor puppy named Lucky. Enrique did not stop what he was doing at all. He continued to point the knife at different parts of the dog's abdomen as if looking for a proper spot for dissection. A few seconds later, he replied slowly and nonchalantly: \n"As you said, it's a dead dog, so I can do anything I want to it. Don't you want to know what it's like inside a dog that hasn't turned into a zombie dog? Think about this. If I can learn something useful from the dissection, the dog is making a contribution to scientific research in a way." \n"Stop it. You're not Dr. Gallo. You don't know a thing about biology!" \n"Right. That's why I need to practice." \n"Lucky died when she tried to protect my father's lab from zombies. You can't treat her like what you did to those useless rubbish." \n"But it's dead already, isn't it? Once it's dead, it's useless." \nEnrique, who was only in his teens, showed his cold and ruthless nature that was more terrifying than what you could see from an adult. In his eyes, things were either "useful" or "useless." Emotions were not worth a thing to him. Looking at Enrique's emotionless eyes for a few seconds, little Natalie gave up. She ran away to ask for help from his father, Dr. Gallo. Just as Enrique was about to continue his dissection, someone came over while giving him a round of applause. The stranger was in a cape with skull-shaped patterns on it. \n"Impressive! Well said, young man!" The man continued in his lunatic tone, "I've been looking for someone like you, someone who could think bold and act bold at such a young age! You are born to be one of the Vindicators!" \n"Vindicators...what do you mean?" \n"An organization made of only the strong. We do not convince a person with words, but fists." \n"An organization of the strong? Sounds interesting, this Vindicators group." \n"Looking forward to seeing you at our next meeting then." \nThe man handed young Enrique an invitation letter and went away. He knew he didn't need to say anything else. The child who could say something like "Once it's dead, it's useless" would definitely join the Vindicators one day, sooner or later.
251036=Blanche was a bad student who had just dropped out of school. She also had another important identity, the lead singer of an underground band. Her powerful voice and impressive guitar play soon won her great fame. The band was also known by more people because of its passionate and addictive songs. The day the band held its first underground heavy metal concert, the apocalypse broke out unexpectedly. \n"Deathcore! Deathcore! Deathcore!" \nThe fans shouted out the name frantically to welcome the band onto the stage. After a short high-pitched sound, the spotlight shone upon the center of the stage, and Blanche stepped onto the stage, with a guitar in her hand. The audience burst into louder cheers. The crowd called Blanche's nickname over and over again.\n"Metalhead! Metalhead!" \n"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the deathcore party!! Tonight, we'll revive from death. Tonight, we'll bring you a new song that keeps your heart pounding! Now listen — the Roar of Death!" \nA good song was always the best way to show appreciation to the support from the fans. Blanche and her teammates nodded at each other. With the drummer dropped the first beat, a sensational melody started. People began to dance to the beat. As the song reached its climax, the cheers grew louder. No one noticed that, at this moment, someone opened his crimson eyes among the crowd, with his limbs twisted in a creepy way. He seemed to be saying something, but his voice was low and hoarse. \n"Heh, stay away from me! It's a place to listen to music, okay? Heh! What the heck! What are you doin'?" \nAs a lady raised her voice to warn the "stranger" standing way too close to her, another person turned around to see what happened. As he was trying to pat on the shoulder of the guy who "disturbed" others, he somehow paused midway, with his arm freezing in the air. The next second, he was bitten on his neck by the "weird" guy. The zombie virus began to spread rapidly against the deafening music. It was not until a zombie crawled onto the stage and tried to bite the drummer that Blanche realized what actually happened. The performance immediately paused; more audience noticed the "weirdly behaving" guys around them. In contrast to the deafening music just now, the entire hall was filled with screams and cries. \nThe guitar, which had gone through a special modification before the performance, now became an excellent weapon that came in handy. In order to help the audience get out of the hall, Blanche brandished her beloved guitar to clear a way for them. The metal guitar hit the heads of one zombie and another, making strange yet unique sounds. It sounded like the whisper of the Reaper, an overture to a new chapter of death.
251037="Dad...how you doin' today?" \nLying on the bed with a pale face, Alice said in a light-hearted tone and forced out a smile at Roland who dropped by the hospital to see her, but her clenched fist and the sweat-soaked bed sheet "gave her out." Roland was heartbroken to see the scene. He walked to the bedside, extending his hand to warm the cold hand of Alice, and replied gently: \n"Alice, just a few more days to go. Dad's research will be soon completed. Then we'll replace your heart with a metal one, strong enough to help you grow healthily like everyone else. It's gonna be alright. Everything's gonna be alright...okay?" \nRoland, a shrewd and successful businessman, now was just a father somewhat panicked at his daughter's aggravating illness. He kept comforting her with repeated words, as if the more times he repeated, the more likely it would come true. A day ago, the doctor told them about the new treatment plan — a heart transplant, as Roland mentioned. Alice failed to hide the fear on her face this time, no matter how hard she tried. She was a seven-year-old child after all. The unsuccessful treatments previously were a torment to both her body and mind. She had enough of the agony all over her body. Compared to the tiny hope of recovery, the young girl was more afraid of the unknown pain. \n"Prosthetic surgery...will it hurt?" \n"No, Dad will never let any pain torture you again. I promise." \nRoland promised her in a soft yet resolute voice. He had been proceeding with the prosthetic experiment personally over the past years. He even volunteered to be the first one to receive the prosthetic transplant surgery to test its safety. He replaced his right arm, with which he first held his beloved daughter, with a prosthetic arm, hoping that the metallic arm could be strong enough to protect her daughter from any harm. But he never expected that, by the time he woke up in the ward, the doctor told him that his daughter failed to make it this morning and passed away. \n"NOOOO! That's not true! Alice is just sleeping...there...there must be a way to cure her...virus? zombie? Ahh!" \nRoland carefully placed his daughter in the sleep pod. Looking at Alice who he believed was "having a sound sleep", Roland was now taken over by madness: "Hold on, sweetheart! Dad will find a way to wake you up!"
251038=Beesly was the most notorious name in the town. Who was he? A delinquent who did nothing else but pick up troubles, roam around, and sneak things from his neighbors as a way to collect the so-called "protection fee." He was the one that everyone hated in the town. The day the zombie crisis broke out, however, he somehow turned into another man.\n"Mommy, where are you? Daddy...Daddy is so scary right now! Help, Mom…"\n"Lily! Don't be afraid. Mommy's here. Now get out through that window! I'll help you stop Daddy."\nHer father, who turned into a zombie, now was getting closer to the room where she and her mother were hiding. The little girl dragged the arm of her mother who fell into a coma, trying to wake her up. Hearing her daughter's cry, the mother regained consciousness slowly, but she was not able to stand up given her legs that were hit in the fights against her "husband." The only thing she could do was to crawl all the way to the door and keep the door shut with her body, to earn Lily more time to run away. The saddening fact was, even if Lily made it to get out, how many days a little girl like her could survive alone in the apocalyptic times? The mother dared not think further. As she was overwhelmed by the devastating situation, the zombie outside the door stopped pounding on the door.\n"Now get lost! Out of my way! Who's there? The zombie was thrown out. Now come out. You're safe!”\nThe mother heard the loud and irritable voice of Beesly from behind the door, along with the sound of the zombie falling heavily to the ground. Not receiving any response from inside, Beesly began to knock on the door, more violently than the zombie did before. The appearance of the grumpy man gave the woman and her daughter a gleam of hope at the desperate moment.\n"Mommy! A hero has come to save us! Look, a real hero!"\n"Heh! Little girl. Stop callin' me a hero. I'll consider exempting your protection fee if you behave as a good kid." Beesly said so in a seemingly intimidating tone and laid his hand on the little girl’s shoulder, trying to stop her from getting closer. But the girl was not scared at all by the "hero" in her eyes.\n"Beesly… I never thought... Anyway, thank you so much." The mother wiped the tears from her face and looked at Beesly with gratitude. Beesly, who used to argue a lot with this neighbor, felt a bit guilty and uneasy thinking of what he had done before. He then waved his hand and put on an indifferent look:\n"Enough with the tears. You paid the protection fee, I did my job. Not a big deal." He extended his hand to help the woman stand up. The three then left the saddening place and headed to the fortress in the neighboring town. The scene on the streets was even worse. Countless bodies were on both sides of the road. To distract the little girl, Beesly started a conversation with her:\n"I can see you are very brave and got great force. I'll give you some real training when we get to the fortress. Then you can be as strong as me."\n"You mean I can be a heroine myself and protect my mom from zombies?"\n"Surely you will. It'll just take a few more years' time."
251039="Pamela, how come you only got second place in the competition?"\n"Stop playing with them. Are you done with your training today? Do not leave the shooting range before you hit the target!"\n"Pamela, I'm so upset. I don't get it. How could my kid be so incompetent? Your father and I are both Olympic champions. How can you fail over and over again without making any progress?"\nEvery time Pamela stood in the shooting range, the criticisms from her parents would be repeated in her mind, making her more panicked and terrified every time she made a mistake. The shooting range used to be the place she loved the most. Now it was a hell full of nightmare. She stared at the human-shaped targets in the distance, as if she saw a bunch of monsters mocking how "incompetent" she was. Her trembling hands now made it impossible for her to pull the trigger.\n"If I can't hit the target, the whole thing is meaningless. Maybe what mom and dad are correct. I just don't have the talent for this."\nPamela thought to herself in despair. The idea made her become more silent. One day, she put her beloved pistol in the box, together with her shattered dream.\n"Hey, Pamela, isn't it the day of the youth shooting competition today? Why are you still here? I got a new cheerleading outfit. Good luck for our sharpshooter!" Little Lori knocked on the window pane and peered at the inside from the half-open window.\n"Go watch the competition yourself. Please leave me alone. I won't be able to get the first place anyway. Cheer for someone else then." Pamela said so in a gloomy mood.\n"Pamela! What's goin' on? You know I watch the competition not for the champion, but for my best friend, you!" Lori frowned and knocked on the window pane again.\n"Cheer up, my best friend and the best shooter!"\n"Forget about it. I can't be the champion anyway. That'll waste all your efforts." Pamela tried to shut the window, only to find Lori was no longer there.\n"Who cares about that title!" Lori's loud voice suddenly sounded from outside the door. She dashed into the room and took out the box from under the bed. Ignoring Pamela's refusal, Lori still handed the pistol to her and said: "I don't care who wins. What I want to see is my dear Pamela who can stay calm and poised in the competition and hit the target like nothing can stop her."\n"C'mon. Let's give it another go. I'll go with you."
251040=In the early days of the apocalypse, humans freshly managed to rebuild their community. Every place was haunted by a gloomy and depressing air. A wave of zombie attacks just ended. Humans suffered heavy casualties again. More than half of the adults were killed or injured, leaving some elderly people or people with disabilities using as much force as they had to bandage the wounded and bury the dead. One could see little hope in the eyes of the people. The waves of zombie attacks took away so many lives. No one knew who would be the next. Everyone was living with a countdown over their heads; more and more people gave up on survival and began to wait calmly for the reaper to take them away.\n"Anyone there? I need some help!"\nLori, who had just escaped from a zombie siege, finally arrived at the human community after three days of walking, thanks to the clues left by other survivors. She shouted for help at the gate, but no one responded. The silence even made her believe the entire community had fallen. When she saw the clothes hanging on the other side of the wall and tire trails left recently, she knew there must be people living there. But why no one showed up yet or responded to her? Lori found the place a bit weird.\n"Go somewhere else." When Lori knocked on the gate half a minute later, the lifeless eyes of an old lady appeared from the crack of the gate.\nThe old lady opened the door slowly and told Lori what happened to the community. Behind the gate were all wounded soldiers and abandoned children. They could barely find a dozen soldiers who could still fight on the battlefield among all residents in the community. One zombie could easily kill the last batch of survivors here. Lori was not the first one who visited the community. Many came here before to seek help, but they all left after learning about the terrible situation here. The old lady did not expect that Lori would stay, so she waved at Lori and signaled Lori to leave if she wanted to find another shelter.\n"Leave? Why would I leave? We have so many survivors here! I finally have a place to stay!"\n"Did you listen to what I said? All the survivors here can't even fight off a single zombie. The community won't last long."\n"If we can't beat them, we may hide from them for the moment. There will always be a way to live on. Don't give up this easily, ma'am!" Lori's voice was like a ray of sunshine, lighting up the dull community and bringing people a gleam of hope.
251041="Annie, I'll go collect some food. I'll be back before it's getting dark. Remember, do not open the door for anyone, even if the guy claims to be a survivor like us, okay?" \nFiona, who was doing her final preparations before she went out to gather resources, reminded her younger sister again of the potential threat from strangers. Months ago, Annie agreed to let a child who was asking for help into the house and ended up being attacked by the robber waiting outside. Although Fiona went back in time and prevented any further losses, the scars left on Annie's arm remained a regretful memory for Fiona. \n"Fiona, I'm 16 now. I want to do something to help you support the family." Annie took over Fiona's pistol and made an awkward shooting pose, trying to prove how much she had grown up. \n"Fine. Good for you. You're now a 'big kid' who's as tall as the height of my chest." Fiona replied coldly, snatching back the pistol and holding it high with one hand so that Annie could not reach it. "You're helping me a lot when you stay at home as I say." \n"There you go again! I'm not a kid anymore. I can..." \n"Alright. Alright. So how about this? When you turn 18, I'll teach you how to fight zombies, okay? Now, just stay home and wait for me." \n"Deal!" \nFiona, who went out hunting as usual, did not expect that this random promise would be the last conversation with her younger sister. By the time she returned, she found the iron door, which was ten centimeters thick, had been completely corroded by an unknown poison. The living room was messy. Something bad must have happened. She gripped her gun and walked into Annie's bedroom, only to find a zombie with greenish liquid dripping from its mouth sitting next to her body. The fact was in the apocalypse, humans were not the only ones trying to get used to the changing environment. Zombies were evolving too. They even developed some new "abilities" while eating their own kind. \nFiona, who always thought that she could be there protecting Annie, believed there was no need to make Annie face the harsh reality and the deadly zombies so early. She did not expect that the inability to fight put Annie in danger when a zombie broke in one day. \n"If I had not treated her as a kid and taught her how to fight a zombie, would things be different?"\nEvery night, when Fiona looked at the photo of herself and Annie, she would pose the question to herself over and over again. She would not get any answer though. She could only try to find the answer by giving her trainees strict training and teaching more young people how to fight zombies. \n"My son is only seven years old! You shouldn't be so harsh on him! Look at the wounds on his body. I'm gonna report you! You're abusing him!" In the community, a mother holding a boy with wounds on his body was accusing Fiona of her harsh way of training. \n"Of course, I can teach him later." Fiona said coldly, believing the lady was simply spoiling her child. "Unfortunately, zombies won't wait until a child grows up before killing him."
251042=In the serene and isolated suburb, a magnificent manor stood on a hillside surrounded by lush jungles. Away from the bustling city, the place was one of the few "virgin lands" in the early stages of the zombie apocalypse. Yet the situation did not last long. One day, a servant who went out to get supplies was accidentally scratched by a zombie. The moment his crimson eyes opened marked the falling of this secret paradise. \n"Let us go. It's the day for the expedition on the hill!" \nDressed in haute couture, the young master Galande who held young Theodore in rags by his hand argued with the butler who tried to stop him from going out. He had just promised his new buddy that he would take him on a fun expedition; a minute later, he was stopped at the gate. The young master felt somewhat awkward.\n"Master Galande, it's quite dangerous out there. Zombies are found in our manor. The helicopter will be here very soon. Could you wait for a while and continue your expedition until you arrive at the safe zone?" \nAlthough the butler was warning the young master of the danger outside, he did not show the slightest trace of panic at all. He knew they did not need to worry about safety and survival, given the power and influence of the Galande family. He even asked the chef to make a dessert for the young master to find him something to do while waiting, despite that survivors outside were fighting each other for food. \n"What about others? The gardeners and chefs, will they go with us?" \n"You know, the helicopter does not have that many seats." \nTheodore, who stayed silent for a while, posed a question hesitantly. The butler answered him like this in a polite yet decisive tone. Obviously, those "unimportant servants" were not included in the relocation plan in the first place. The butler did not frown for a second, as if the servants' lives mattered not to him.\n"B-but...how can they fight off zombies if they stayed here? They would die." \n"Everyone will die. The weak are only more susceptible. Anyway, you and I are still alive, right? No need to worry about those unimportant to us." \nGalande, who grew up with the idea of "survival of the fittest", could not understand why Theodore cared so much about the servants. He believed he was generous enough to invite Theodore to leave the place together. Why the latter did not appreciate his friendly gesture, and even stared at him with an angry look? \n"You mean the lives of the weak could be given up this easily? Have you ever thought of what would happen if one day you were no longer with the 'team of the strong'?" \n"Ha-ha. No way. I am and will always be the strongest." \n"I see." \nTheodore, who had always been by Galande's side, turned around and left. He refused the "kind invite" to go to the safe zone with Galande. Instead, he ran to notify all servants to leave the manor as fast as they could. Witnessing how Theodore ran towards the servants' room where zombies were roaming around without hesitation, Galande began to doubt himself for the first time: \n"Did I say something wrong? Why would he rather go back to that dangerous place than leave with me?" \n"There will always be such people who can't tell what matters most. It's not your fault, Master Galande. Your way of thinking is quite similar to your father, I have to admit. You'll surely grow up into an outstanding decision maker."
251043=The fifth year into the apocalypse, the social order collapsed. The dark side of human nature was unraveled. Fighting, looting, capturing, and oppressing...these became commonplace in major human communities. Amid the turmoil, a team in green uniform committed themselves to restoring social order and stability. They were later widely known as the Minutemen. They were the last gleam of hope in the devastating apocalypse. "Wherever Minutemen go, security and order follow" became the consensus among survivors. \nThe rapid growth of the Minutemen soon aroused the attention of the management of the human community. Afraid of losing its influence and, more importantly, its privileges, the management obstructed the rescue missions of Minutemen. As a result, many missions ended in failure. This made Bolton, an officer of the Minutemen, realize that they needed to "handle" the threats if they really wanted to make the organization stronger. At this time, a soldier volunteered to eradicate the enemies for the organization. \n"Theodore, have you thought this over?" Bolton looked at the young soldier in front of him, trying to remind him what he was doing: \n"The 'lifetaker' we are looking for needs to keep his identity completely concealed. By 'completely concealed', I mean you'll have to discard your identity, face and voice, and every single trace of your existence in the past. To protect other 'lifetakers', they will not be allowed to bury you even if you die in the mission. Are you sure you will accept all these conditions?" \n"Someone has to go. I'm an ideal candidate, right?" Theodore picked up the mask on the table and put it on: "Hmm... It fits me perfectly. Looks like I'm really the right person." \nLooking at Theodore's decisive action, Bolton said nothing more. He handed Theodore the forged identity and more info on the enemies. He then patted Theodore on his shoulder, bidding him farewell with a salute: \n"From the moment you leave the barracks, you will be marked as dead in the Minutemen list. Except for sending you the mission info, we will not contact you in any form. You are all on your own. Theodore...ah, sorry...Roger the Lifetaker, may you successfully clear the way for us and complete your mission." \n"Copy that."
251044="D-doc...doc! Please come with me. Unn has gone mad. He kept attacking people!"\n"Alright. Easy. I'll go with you right now."\nWhen Dean dashed into the tent of Jessie the Witch Doctor, Jessie was making some meds with her pot. The clumsy Dean bumped into the pot, spilling all the meds over the floor. On hearing the urgent situation, Jessie left the pot where it was and wiped her hands on her clothes, after which she picked up a few bottles of meds and left home with Dean in a minute.\n"Get out of the way, guys. The witch doctor is here!"\n"Great, it's the witch doctor! Poor Unn can be saved!"\n"How do you do, Jessie!"\n"Thank you for coming here so fast, doc."\nThe crowd around the mad Unn stepped back when they saw Jessie. Everyone greeted Jessie with great respect. Jessie wasted no time and went directly to the patient, who was tied to a pillar by the warriors. He was yelling something at the crowd, with his eyes turning crimson and greenish and sticky liquid drooling from his mouth. As Jessie got closer to him, he began to pounce forward like a ferocious dog. His was so strenuous that the thick pillar was almost moved a bit from the ground. If it was not for the rope, Jessie would have been bitten by him.\n"Watch out! Unn lost his mind. You'd better not get too close to him, doc."\n"It's okay. Anyone knows what Unn did before he developed this symptom?" Jessie was not scared by Unn's attack. In her eyes, the mad Unn was no different from other patients. She also firmly believed that as long as she figured out the signs before he got sick, found the cause, and gave him the right medicine, she would be able to cure him.\n"He didn't do anything special. We just went out hunting as usual. Oh, I remember! There was a weirdo when we came back. Unn asked him if he needed any help and then got bitten by him! That guy's so weird. By the time he came back, he lost his sanity."\n"A weird man? Any other special traits on him?"\n"Let me think. His eyes were red. Saliva was drooling from his mouth. When he saw us, he ran after us! And then Unn got bitten! The man was as lunatic as...as the way Unn is behaving right now."\n"A disease transmitted by biting? Never heard of it."\nJessie went through all the rare diseases in her mind, but failed to find a similar one. This was the first time Jessie was caught in such a tricky situation. She felt a little uneasy, but still forced herself to calm down and pass on the order in time to the warriors waiting behind her: "Dean, move Unn to the tent. Irma, ask if anyone else got bitten in the tribe. Gather them in the tents, if any. Remember, do not get bitten when transferring the patients."\n"Doc, will my dad be okay?" Unn's youngest daughter held Jessie's leg and asked so with some tears left on her panicked face.\n"Of course, your dad is just sick. When we find the cure, he will go back to health right away." Jessie gently stroked the girl's head and answered. It was a promise both to the little girl and the entire tribe.
251045=Between dilapidated buildings, a group of survivors with dust and mud on their bodies embraced each other with joy. Just now, they fought off a zombie horde together. This victory proved that the shelter now had the ability to defend itself and secure people's daily production and life. A new human community thus took shape. That night, a celebration event was held. On a cement platform, the host introduced Mr. Lunn, the biggest sponsor of the community.\n"Tonight, we are here to celebrate the establishment of the S community. Now I'll give the floor to Mr. Lunn! Thanks to his generous funding, we could purchase enough weapons to resist the zombie horde this time. Now let's welcome Mr. Lunn to the stage!" \n"Thank you, Mr. Lunn!" \n"Mr. Lunn is really a good man. I heard that he had been running a charity before the apocalypse. He was still so generous in such a difficult time." \n"I want to work in his company. I bet the pay must be good." \nAmid the applause from the crowd, chubby Lunn walked onto the stage slowly. He did not speak anything first, but raised his golden metallic left hand and adjusted the position of his golden tie. Then, under the passionate gaze of the audience, he opened his mouth: \n"Since day one of the apocalypse, Zeus Group has been helping people rebuild their communities and create a better homeland. We are also aware that today's success is built on the efforts of everyone. So tonight, on behalf of Zeus Group, I'd like to invite all talents and craftsmen of the S community to join us! Together, we can create a better future for mankind! Here's also good news for people with disabilities. As long as you sign the contract with Zeus Group, we'll help you get an artificial limb surgery." \nWhat Lunn said was really heartening. The artificial limb surgery made people with disabilities see a gleam of hope. Plus, the name of Zeus Group itself was trustworthy. People all moved to the registration desk on one side of the stage. Looking at the young people who signed their names with passion and great expectations, Lunn nodded with a satisfied smile. At this time, Duke, the host, approached Lunn and talked to him in a low voice: \n"Boss, at least five hundred people will sign up this time, with a hundred of them already signing a "slave contract." I believe...the result is good enough for you to exempt the cost of my artificial hands?" \n"Heh, it's not a 'slave contract.' We call it a welfare." Lunn straightened up and continued with a seemingly compassionate air: "Look at the young men. They idled around in the community all day long. Now I give them artificial limbs and the opportunity to work for us. Isn't this a win-win solution? It's fair for us to charge them 'some' money for this, right? We have to keep our business running, after all." \n"Yes. Exactly, Mr. Lunn. It's indeed a welfare." Duke nodded with a flattering smile. Not receiving any response from Lunn on the money he owed, he brought it up again hesitantly: "So the cost of my..." \n"I see. I'll report it to my superior and lower your interest rate. Keep up the good work. You'll be able to pay it off soon." Lunn patted Duke on his shoulder and said so.\n"Thank you, Mr. Lunn! Thank you so much!" \nDuke thanked Lunn many times for his "consideration and generosity", not knowing the bill of tens of thousands of dollars was actually issued by Lunn himself.
251046=Born into a family of doctors, Alisa showed her medical talent from an early age. When other kids of her age were still playing arcade games, young Alisa could name many common medicines and memorize their side effects. Influenced by her parents, Alisa also wanted to be a doctor. As a prodigy, she worked hard and was admitted to a top medical college at the age of 16. \nLater, the outbreak of the zombie virus changed Alisa's life. That day, one could see people wailing and corpses left on the streets everywhere in the city. Hospitals were packed with wounded residents. Even the dorm of Alisa was taken as an accommodation for the wounded. Still, the number of casualties multiplied. Alisa and other medical students were asked to join the medical care team. \nAlisa took the mission and immediately headed to the front line. As she saw the wounds from knives and guns on more and more soldiers, she realized the enemies they were facing were not only zombies but also humans. \n"See? These wounds are obviously left by a knife." Alisa pointed to the long and narrow wound on a patient's stomach and said, "How could a man be injured by a knife while trying to run away from zombies? He was attacked by a human!" \n"Shhh. Stop it." Park Ji-mi, a classmate of Alisa, covered Alisa's mouth with her hands. She let out a breath after confirming that no one looked in their direction. "Do you know how chaotic the world out there is? After the old order was gone, many were trying to create a new order and be the new 'king.' The contention among the factions is in full fledge. You don't wanna get involved, do you? Do your job and take care of the patients. That's it." \n"But they are all ordinary people. They were attacked or even killed simply because they somehow got involved in the contention between those factions?" \n"That's true. But what can you do about it? Restore the order on your own? Don't forget it's an apocalyptic age!" Another peer who did not get along quite well with Alisa mocked her. \n"But..." Alisa was caught speechless. But from that day on, the determination to "restore order" began to take shape in her mind. \n"There must be a way. What should I do?" Every night, Alisa, who tossed and turned on the bed, would think like this: \n"Treating the wounded day by day won't stop more deaths caused by the war. I need to do more. But what exactly can I do? How I wish to find a large group of people who wish to restore the order and work together with them."
251047=Headline of World Daily\n"On X/X, the highly anticipated underground railway project finally came to an end. This is the first underground railway in human history. Mr. Pearson, the manager of the project, named the system "subway." Citizens' attitudes toward the new invention were divided. Our special correspondent, Emma, went to the construction site to bring you the latest updates."\n"The first underground railway will start running next Monday. What do you think about it?"\n"Underground? Railway? Eww... That sounds dirty and terrible. I don't need this underground thing." replied Cara, a stubborn and old-fashioned granny in the neighborhood. She continued with a disdainful tone: "With the time and money spent on it, we could have at least two more convenient public transit routes. What's the point of going underground anyway?"\n"That's the first subway ever! Many people want to be among the first batch of passengers! I'll queue up early in the morning tomorrow!" said young courier Jack who appeared to be very interested in the new type of railway. He even took a day off especially to engage in the inauguration tomorrow.\n"Are you talking about that new thing called...uhh...subway! I've heard quite a lot about it." On seeing the reporter, Kate immediately came up to show off the "insider info" she collected: "That subway is designed by Pearson, you know, the guy known for his unbelievable OCD designs! His projects were never delayed or found to be flawed. This subway might bring great changes to the overly crowded city!"\n"Looks like everyone has their own unique insights into the subway. Will it become another milestone in Pearson's career or a flawed design to be polished? We'll see tomorrow!"\nThe next morning, the subway entrance was packed with crowd. In the face of the questions posed by the curious crowd and a bunch of doubts regarding the subway's safety presented by some insignificant news agency, Pearson walked to the makeshift podium next to the locomotive of the subway and delivered his speech.\n"I always believe that transportation is the fundamental factor that drives urban development. Given the crowded and messy urban transportation on the ground, however, I decided to make a breakthrough underground. I know many of you still have doubts about my design. Today, I'll show you how solid the tunnel is, how the smoke is ventilated from the tunnel, and how the safety of passengers can be guaranteed. I'll invite you all to observe with your own eyes, rather than bother you with boring numbers and documents. Of course, I will join you and be the first passenger on this subway. Action speaks louder than words after all."\nAfter finishing his short speech, Pearson boarded the subway. Although many passengers were still waiting on the platform and dared not get into the subway, he did not bother to explain more. By the time the boarding period ended, the red light on the locomotive lit up, with the doors sliding closed and the train starting up slowly and heading away.\n"A new trail has been blazed; the subway will bring us closer than ever!"
251048=It was a tranquil afternoon in the community. Thirteen-year-old Laura was collecting metal and paper in the waste transfer station with her friends, to sell them and earn some more money for her poor family. Laura saw Harrison heading her way and she knew Harrison was the one managing the farm of the community. \n"He works with people in the farm and cafeteria, he must have some good stuff in store? At least, he could spare some food for me!" Laura thought to herself. Then she ran to the gate with her friends to greet Harrison. \n"Good afternoon, Mr. Harrison! Let me help you drop the garbage." \n"Oh, it's you, Laura. Thank you for your help then. You may drop the lighter bag for me." \nWith a big smile and sweet voice, Laura took a heavy garbage bag from Harrison. The next second, she opened the bag to see what was inside, only to find some rotten and worm-infested leftovers. \n"All leftovers? How come?" Laura was disappointed and complained: "The food supplied by the cafeteria is barely enough. Many people are staving. Why are there so many wasted food? This is WAY too much."\n"Good question. This is a long-standing problem... To save some time when cooking, the chefs would always take the fresh vegetables from the top, leaving those placed at the bottom stacked there for months. In the end, they all ended up rotten and inedible... Never mind. Why would I tell you something like this? You don't understand how things work anyway." \nHarrison was not able to do anything about it. He also hated to waste vegetables, but he couldn't ask people to cook the rotten stuff. Making people sick would be an even worse scenario. That's why he dumped them right away. \n"I understand things, okay? They were wasted because they were not sorted out in time order. I get scolded by my mom when I leave my toys everywhere in the house. That's how I learned to sort out stuff by size and shape to tide up the place real quick."\n"Good to know. Looks like we need to hire a bright girl like you to help us with our management." Harrison patted Laura on her head and went away. But little Laura took his words seriously. \nSince then, Laura stopped her "treasure hunt" routine. Instead, she stayed all day long in the dark and stuffy warehouse, observing what the workers were doing. Her parents thought she was idling away her time, while the workers found she got in the way. No one expected that a young girl could make some really useful suggestions. Laura did not mind what others thought about her. She bound some draft paper she found in the waste transfer station into a notebook, and used a charred branch as a pen to scribble down her insights into goods management. \nTwo months later, when community manager Wolowitz received the notes drafted by little Laura, he immediately realized the suggestions were quite practical.\n"Good rules are good in nature, despite the age of the rule maker." Wolowitz then put Laura's rules into use in his actual management regardless of others' objections. \nThanks to Laura's suggestions, more inlets were added to the warehouse for goods to be transported inside, shortening the queuing time; some movable shelves were added and more personnel were assigned to sort out the vegetables and fruits, reducing the waste by 30%. The space utilization rate was also increased by a good 20%. Laura convinced others what she could do with her outstanding management skills. More mega communities began to learn from the good practices in logistics and transportation.
251049=A baby's cry sounded in the pitch-black woods. That was how newborn Marlen announced her arrival to the world in her blankets. The cries that should have aroused her parents' love and affection, attracted a red-eyed beast - a scarred gray wolf - from the forest instead. After her mate's death in a battle against the king of the wolves, the lone wolf lost her cubs and was expelled from the pack. In desperate need of food, she knew that she would be a meal for other beasts if she failed to fill her stomach. Luckily, she found a vulnerable prey - a human baby. \nAs a bloody mouth approached, Marlen, unaware of the imminent danger, moaned as if pleading for her mother to hold her, as she sensed the warmth of the wolf's breath. The cub-like sound made the wolf falter. She retracted her fangs and moved closer to Marlen, sniffing her repeatedly, as if to tell whether or not she was the cub she had lost. A moment later, she opened her mouth again. This time, she didn't do it to snap Marlen's neck, but instead took her under her belly and began to lick the poor child. The thin milk mixed with the blood from the wolf's wounds became Marlen's first meal in the world. In the warmth of the embrace, Marlen gradually quieted down. It was at this moment that the instinct of motherly love overcame the predatory nature. The wild wolf became a mother and Marlen had a family. \nFeeding on wolf's milk and raw meat, Marlen grew up in the wild. She didn't have the chance to learn how to walk or speak like a human, but with her mother's guidance, she developed a keen intuition like a wild animal and excellent hunting and trapping skills. Although Marlen was somewhat puzzled by the fact that her sparse fur was so different from that of her mother's, the difference in appearance didn't make her less dependent on her mother. She was deeply attached to her mother, and also equally attached to the forest where she grew up. \nThe invasion of the human world by the zombie virus, however, and the dwindling resources of living, caused a lot of people to set their eyes on the forest, where both opportunities and challenges remained. One day, a squad of gun-toting adventurers walked into the forest. Marlen, who was lurking in the bushes from afar, saw them.\nThis type of "animal" with two legs and standing upright was something she had never seen before. They had the same limbs and appearance as herself but spoke a totally unintelligible language. Marlen's eyes were filled with human-like curiosity. \n"What is that, prey? Or an enemy?' \nMarlen was puzzled, yet the similarity in appearance made her begin to mimic their movements. She copied the man with the gun in the distance, slowly raising her own hand, stretching it, clenching her fist, and then tentatively reaching for the stone on the ground. As her five fingers slowly clenched together, Marlen grasped something for the first time. the cold touch of the stone in her palm startled Marlen, who dropped it in a hurry. Without bothering to finish her hunting plans for the day, she went back towards the cave to find her mother. \nHer mother, who was already in her old age, didn't have much to show for today's hunt. After a busy day, she only brought back a small, thin hare. Seeing that Marlen, who had returned to the cave without a gain, she did not get angry. Rather, she limped over to Marlen and got down beside her, using her tongue to clean up the shreds of Marlen's hair. Her mother's embrace gradually calmed Marlen. She wrapped her arms around her mother, repeating over and over in her mind. \n"I'm my mother's child, I'm my mother's child..."\nBut today's imitation of that two-legged animal grasping a rock lingered in her mind. A voice sounded in Marlen's mind:\n"Maybe the creature I saw today has something to do with myself..."
251050=When talking about Irma, people in the tribe all marveled at her incredible strength. Carrying logs and digging up ore...the time-consuming and labor-intensive work for ordinary people was as simple as eating and drinking in Irma's eyes. The aged chief also complimented that thanks to Irma, the tribe was able to regain its foothold in the doomsday, which suggested that he considered Irma to be a capable candidate for the next chief.\n"Guys, get up!! It's an earthquake! Quake's coming!"\nIt was late at night when the people in deep sleep were awakened by Irma's loud voice. Before they could have time to realize what actually happened, deafening tremors came. Beds creaked and shook; walls crumbled; as soon as people fled from their homes to the tribal plaza, the dust rolled off the mountains in the distance. Even the sacred stone that always stood at the top of the mountain range fell along with the falling debris.\n"Look! Our sacred stone...the sacred stone has fallen!"\n"No! The falling of the sacred stone...marks the end of our tribe!!"\nAs the crowd exclaimed, the sacred stone, which was part of the faith of the tribe, tumbled down, becoming the last straw that overwhelmed everyone. Everyone was wailing and whining as if they had already seen the future of the tribe's downfall. The warriors who had gone to investigate the situation came back one after another, reporting the latest findings with their heads drooping in despair.\n"Bad news, folks. The sacred stone cut off the river. We tried to destroy or move it, but it was just too hard to move it an inch. By next week at the very latest, or three days at the soonest, our tribe's water source will completely dry up."\n"Things were just picking up these days... Now my tribe is doomed like this."\n"Without water, we couldn't survive for many days."\n"Where else can we go in this sheer wilderness."\nAs the sadness pervaded the crowd, Irma stood out in the silence. "There must be a way. It's not the time to give up yet. Wait, I'll take a look up there."\nThe solid rock indeed sank into the muddy river. Irma attempted to push it, but even with her immense strength, she could only make the sacred stone shake a bit. It was obviously impossible to get the sacred stone out of the way. Irma stared at the stone for quite a while. Suddenly, she clenched her fists and punched the stone with all her force.\n*Creaking... A huge crack miraculously appeared in the center of the sacred stone and quickly widened out.\n"Whatever stone it is, only those that don't get in the way are good stones." Irma, who had successfully tackled the problem, clapped her hands. "But it's hard to find such a hard stone. Guess I'll make a weapon out of it. That would be good enough for a solid stone like this."
251051=Duncan was a well-known bounty hunter in the wilderness, but the thing that actually made him known was not his outstanding shooting skills, but his strange principle of taking quests.\nPayment delivered after the job is done? Missions to be carried out late at night? Hunting the elderly, children, or women? An order that had been taken by another bounty hunter before? None of these fell into Duncan's "scope of business." Despite his demanding requirements, however, Duncan still received a constant number of offers from people. They chose him simply because they knew he was the only one who could get the job done with a zero failure rate. As a saying circulating among people went: "Got any trouble? Go find the Ranger; hand him the money, and you'll receive the good news later." The "Ranger" mentioned here referred to Duncan, a unique bounty hunter.\nOn a day when he had no mission, Duncan was savoring a bottle of flavored fruit wine in the tavern. Soon, a stout man with a leather briefcase came in. He first looked around the place, with a typical condescending look on his face as all city dwellers did when they saw the poor condition of this shabby tavern in the countryside. When he caught a glimpse of Duncan, who sat in the corner with his legs crossed, he instantly shifted to a flattering look and approached Duncan with his back bowed.\n"How do you do? You must be the Ranger! I have a bounty quest here. Would you like to have a look?" As he spoke, the man took out a piece of paper with the target's profile. He also patted on his chest trying to reassure Duncan, "Don't worry, this time, the mission is gonna be easy, with rich rewards offered. We have absolute faith in your ability and credibility. That's why we specifically hope to recruit you, Mr. Duncan, for the job."\nOn hearing the man calling his real name, Duncan, who appeared indifferent a minute ago, gained interest and took over the file to have a read of it.\n"Hmm...Zeus Group... daughter of the general manager... Penny?" after confirming the info on the offer, however, Duncan put on a grim face. "Dude, you know I never lay hands on kids. Also, Zeus Group? How dare you pick up a trouble with them?"\n"Ha-ha. Good point. Yes, the girl is with Zeus Group, that's why we decided to come to you." On seeing that Duncan seemed to have an interest in the quest, the man placed the briefcase loaded with banknotes on the table openly, and continued, "As long as the quest is accomplished, all this is yours!"\n"Sorry. Not interested." Duncan glanced at the pile of banknotes for no more than a second, before rejecting the visitor decisively.\n"Wait, I see... How about this? I'll talk to my boss to see if we can double the amount. It's just a kid, right? Easy to handle, especially for you. Our men will help distract the guards. Things will surely go well."\nThe man thought Duncan was only trying to ask for more bounty, so he took out a couple of bank cards from his pocket and threw them next to the briefcase. His aggressive attitude turned Duncan's impatience into a rage. Duncan extinguished his cigarette directly on the man's hand, and warned him in a harsh tone:\n"Don't make me repeat it twice! NO KIDS! You hear me? Looks like you forgot my rules. But today, I don't mind reminding you for the last time." That said, Duncan loaded his shotgun and aimed it at the visitor.\n"Three, two..." he counted down in a slow manner.\n"Alright. Remember! This is no good for you. You'll pay your price sooner or later!" Seeing that Duncan was not interested in any further negotiations, the man packed up his money and left the tavern in a hurry.\n"One!" As Duncan counted to one, a gunshot was fired. The bullet almost scraped the man's cheek and landed on the wooden planks of the doorway. Watching the man disappear from the door, Duncan spat with impatience, pulled down the brim of his hat, and leaned back into the couch to take a break with his eyes closed.
251052=Pheidias' bosom was always filled with love for art and romance. Even in the zombie-infested apocalypse, he still believed that literature and art were irreplaceable, and could soothe the heart in the most direct and quickest way possible. As paints and brushes were extremely hard to come by in the apocalypse, Pheidias opted for a more easily preserved and created form of artwork - carving.\n"I hope that people will be able to see an exquisite statue no matter how far away they are. It will be like a lighthouse, guiding every lost survivor to our community."\nAs he spoke of his work, the kindness of a father to his child shone in Pheidias' eyes. He presented his carving idea to the community owner, hoping to get his approval for erecting a giant statue in the community plaza, so that it could become a faith of survival for the people who were muddling through their lives.\n"Pheidias, honestly, I do appreciate your mastery of art. This goddess statue you carved is lifelike. I'm in no doubt that it would definitely be a favorite item if it were to be kept in the art gallery." The head of the community patted Pheidias on the shoulder, not mincing his words in praising Pheidias' talent and work. But when Pheidias believed that he had finally found a community that was willing to accept the statue, the community head continued:\n"But, you know, it's the Doomsday. There are no more art galleries, and sadly, your statue won't do any good. We're having a hard time just surviving. How can we afford to support your carving project of a giant statue? Give up your unrealistic fantasies before it's too late, man. It would be better if you use your insights to find more mining sites for the community, and I'm sure with substantial contribution, all the communities will give you a warm welcome."\nFacing the invitation from the last human community nearby, Pheidias refused again without hesitation. Compared to the tragic fate of getting eaten by a zombie, suppressing his creativity and digging day in and day out in caves were what Pheidias found more unacceptable.\n"If I can't work for my dreams, everything will turn meaningless."\nPheidias began to create on his own in the fallen human community. He might die in a zombie attack in a week, or maybe just a day, but he had no remorse as long as he could die in front of his proud work. The repeated banging noise sounded in the empty and abandoned neighborhood. Many days into his carving project, a horde of zombies came toward this way from afar.\n"Damn, the zombies are multiplying. There are many abandoned houses in the neighborhood. We need to find one and take shelter!" In the distance, a survivor squad surrounded by zombies said in despair.\n"Head...that way!" A scouting member looked into the distance and suddenly saw a goddess statue standing among the buildings with her eyes downcast.\n"Guys! That way!" The member shouted with excitement, his tone filled with hope and thrill, "A place with such a majestic and intact statue will surely be an ideal shelter!"
251053="I think we can purify the element through evaporation...look, it's written in the book that it's the safest way to do it." Helen pointed to the success rate of the evaporation method in the book and reasoned her analysis.\n"C'mon. The manual was issued way before you and I were born; it's out of date long ago. I'd say it's easier and faster to just use fire to refine it." Luke picked up his flamethrower and was ready to give it a try.\n"W-wait! The element is too active; contact with fire will cause an explosion!"\nLuke's bold attempt left Helen astonished; fortunately, their mentor came in and interrupted Luke's action.\n"Let's pause the experiment for a while. Come have a look at this." The mentor took out a document labeled with the Zeus Group's logo and placed it in front of the two:\n"This is the first bidding document that Zeus Group has issued to the public since the beginning of the doomsday. It has to do with the field of prosthetics. As you know, our lab is entirely relying on the pathetic funds left. I'm afraid that the lab will have to shut down if we don't get selected for this bidding."\nAs he said that, the mentor poked Luke who appeared completely uninterested in the notice and was already yawning, "You always love to invent weird things like mechanical arms, right? I'll leave this project to you. Helen, assist Luke with the data validation."\n"My invention was something comparable to a work of art, not some "weird thing"! I don't care about the so-called Eden Group or Evil Group; if they don't choose my invention, it's their loss." Luke indignantly defended his invention; obviously, he cared more about his invention than the honor of working with the Zeus Group.\n"Prof, in fact, I've also studied in the field of transplant rejection. As Luke does not have much patience and time for such time-consuming experiments, can you leave this project to me?" Helen, who desperately wanted to yield some fruits in her research, saw that Luke did not look too interested and gathered her courage to seek an opportunity.\n"Oh. But Luke...do you mind...?"\n"Certainly not, that would be great. I don't want to work with those hypocritical entrepreneurs anyway."\n"Well, then, I'll leave you in charge, Helen. You two wrap up and work out a proposal as soon as possible."\nAs she watched their mentor leave the lab, Helen, who had been appointed head of a program for the first time, let out a deep sigh of relief. She then looked over at Luke with a touch of guilt and determination in her eyes:\n"Sorry, Luke. You may not care about the result of the project, but I have to take responsibility for my own future."
251054=David's mother was a daughter of an English noble family, and his father was a famous German chemistry professor; David however was born in the vibrant and lively USA. David's parents provided him with a privileged life but also imposed strict requirements on him. On the one hand, he was able to go horseback riding in the western part of the country during every summer vacation; on the other hand, his father asked him to excel in his studies, while his mother expected him to be upright and virtuous. Overall David had a good time as a teenager; at least today, he still misses the period from time to time.\nBut when he started college, he realized that he couldn't handle the various bottles, jars, and experimental rules of chemistry no matter how hard he tried. This frustration took him farther and farther away from his academic pursuits. When he was on the verge of a breakdown, he lay down on the lawn and recalled how he had spent his time gazing up at the stars in the Wild West in his childhood. From that moment on, his life was lit up.\nYes! The stars were what he hoped to explore for the rest of his life. So he began to devote himself to astrophysical research, studied under the most renowned mentors, and traveled to various countries for seminars and exchanges. But on the very day that he was to publish his important paper, a major incident that happened stole the show.\n"A major speech at the United Nations has confirmed the outbreak of an uncontrollable bio-virus; the world will be entering a state of wartime emergency."\nNo one would look at the stars anymore. As an astrophysicist who has been mentioned in textbooks, David's achievement in cosmology has driven mankind's exploration of the universe many times. But when the doomsday came and survival became the biggest threat, the weak scholar had to think about the challenges he faced in survival first.\nFortunately, Roland, the senior of the same college, sent someone to pick up David and accompanied him to Zeus Group, where he was able to continue his research on celestial bodies. David also proved that his research could be of great use even in the doomsday. Whether it is the robotic arm of Roland with unlimited energy storage, or the AI-powered metal ball hovering around David that can both defend him and attack enemies, both of their driving forces came from the meteorites in outer space that he had struck and reshaped after meticulous calculations.\nIt was no exaggeration to say that although David himself was incapable of fighting on the battlefield, his learning empowered him to create the strongest weapons ever.
251055=In the eyes of little Laurel, the world was crowded and dirty. She grew up in a holey, leaky bedroom; right outside of her bedroom was the place where her mother, a sex worker, offered "services" to her "clients." The curses and beatings of the clients and her mother's habitual begging for mercy were the only sounds in Laurel's life as she grew up.\nAs she grew a bit older, Laurel began to climb onto the roof while her mother was "working"; Laurel would sit there silently and look out into the distance. There, she seemed to be able to see things far away; her vision traveled over the dilapidated roofs and the high walls of the slum, all the way to the high-rise downtown area, where she "saw" the bustling traffic and booming streets.\n*Sigh* "When can I go there to have a look? When can I leave this place..." The bustling of the city appealed to Laurel. She was desperate to leave this place. Yet as a poor kid inhabiting the red light district, obviously she didn't have much choice in deciding where to go.\nHearing Laurel want to go out, her mother glared at her as if she saw another betrayer: "Where do you think you're goin'? Run away like that irresponsible man who doesn't deserve to be called a father? Don't even think about it!"\nWith a suffocating feeling while crying out loud, Laurel's vision blurred. Her mother now looked exactly like a devil, trying to trap her in this doomed place.\n"Huh. I see. You're no more a little girl, right? You wanna do somethin' to support our family! You do know how hard it is for me to raise you all alone, don't you? Now I'll show how you can make some money and be a 'good girl'..."\nThe hands around Laurel's neck finally loosened; the insane mother ignored Laurel's struggles and put on a new outfit for Laurel, for the first time over the years. She never allowed Laurel to touch her cosmetics in the past, but today she applied a thick layer of powder to Laurel's face. After all this, she even tidied up the house, which was a rare thing to be seen in this house. Finally, she put up a wooden plaque carved with flowers outside of the gate.\nLaurel in her new look was asked to stand outside the gate; poor Laurel had to wait for the so-called "new life" with sheer fear and despair.\n"Zeus Group is always committed to the vision of 'leading the entire society to a new world.' After learning that the children here had no access to proper education and had to work for a living at a young age, Roland, our good-hearted CEO decided to visit this place in person and help the children out of their misery."\nThe young man in a suit stood next to blonde-haired Roland, advocating how benevolent the latter was. Despite Roland's condescending air, people around him still kept complimenting him. Roland, at the same time, was looking for a target among the crowd. He was the only one who knew what exactly was the purpose of this "sponsorship" for the poor children. A few seconds later, his eyes landed on little Laurel standing alone in the distance.\n"Sweetheart, wanna see what it's like to live in the big city? We'll give your parents the best subsidies, on condition that you assist us in some simple experiments..."\n"Sure!" Laurel in fact didn't know anything about the "simple experiments", but still she nodded without hesitation when she heard that she could have a chance to live in the city that she craved.\n"It matters not where exactly I go. At least, it won't be any worse than this horrible place."
251056=Kelly was an enigmatic and fascinating woman who stole for a living. Unlike ordinary thieves, she preferred to act in the shadows of the night. She was a top-notch thief, more adept at using shadows and schemes to attain her goals rather than relying mostly on agility and speed, as Galande did.\nKelly used to be an orphan living in the shadows; she didn't know who her parents were or where she came from. She grew up in the dark alleys of the city, making a living through theft and scamming throughout the years. This lifestyle has turned her into an extremely independent and confident woman. It also put her in danger quite often.\nOne day, during one of her thefts, Kelly accidentally triggered a trap and fell into a deep basement. There, she found a mysterious lab filled with all sorts of strange instruments and apparatus. Just as she was trying to run away, a man dressed in black appeared who was claimed to be the owner of this lab.\nHe showed Kelly a whole new world - a world of technology and mystery. He told Kelly that her body and soul possessed great potential; if she was willing to accept his training, she could become powerful enough to rule the world. Although Kelly was not sure about what the man said, she accepted his training tentatively and gradually mastered the skills he taught her.\nAs soon as Kelly mastered all the tricks, the man told her another astounding truth - that he was actually the one who was ruling this world and that Kelly was his biological daughter. Stunned and enraged by this truth, Kelly decided to overthrow his rule and take back everything that was rightfully hers.\nSince then, Kelly went on her quest for revenge. With her skill and intelligence, she planned and acted in the darkness gradually disintegrating her father's rule. Meanwhile, she became the shadow of the city, keeping its peace in the night.
251057=Since his wife's death, Maurer aged a lot and became more silent. A good friend of his could not bear to see how depressed Maurer was, so he introduced him to work in an orphanage. There, Maurer maintained the facilities every day and helped the children to repair their damaged toys. Thanks to the lively and carefree children, Maurer gradually regained his hope for life.\nOne day, Maurer recalled that he had promised to make a swing for the children last week, so he grabbed his toolkit and came to the orphanage early in the morning. As soon as he entered the yard, he was surrounded by children of all ages.\n"Uncle Maurer, could you fix my car? Its wheels won't work!" Ken was among the fastest ones; he stormed to Maurer, holding up his toy car with loose wheels and asking for Maurer's help.\n"Heh! It's your little car again. It broke down a hundred times this month! Uncle Maurer, my windmill isn't running... Please take a look at it." Ann, who was a step slower, pushed her way over to Ken, and shoved the windmill, with its fan blade missing a corner, into Maurer's hand.\nOn hearing the children's passionate cries of "Uncle Maurer", he took out his tools with a big grin, sat down on the stairs outside the door, and began to fix them.\n"One by one, okay? Don't worry, Uncle Maurer will fix ALL your toys; no need to hurry."\nThe caretaker saw Maurer, who started to work before he could catch a breath, and knocked on the heads of the naughty kids. She then chuckled, "You always spoil these little kids. Since they know you can fix anything, they're getting bolder with their toys."\n"Ha-ha. It's okay. Toys are toys. They can play them the way they want, as long as they don't get hurt. Who's next? Hand your toy to Uncle Maurer!"\n"Hooray, Uncle Maurer is the best!!!"\n"Ken loves Uncle Maurer."\n"Ann loves Uncle Maurer, too!"\n"Alright, ladies and gents. Uncle Maurer has to work now, and it's time for you guys to go to class. Good kids should attend class on time, right?"\nSeeing several children leaning on Maurer and reluctant to leave, the caretaker talked the children into heading to the classroom smartly. A while later, she returned and told Maurer about the news she recently heard. \n"From what I've heard in town, there's been an outbreak of madness in many places. Many people went mad and attacked others without reason. You live quite far from here, right? Why don't you stay here over the night?"\n"Is it convenient to offer me accommodation? I mean, I'm only a part-time worker here..."\n"We all see how much the kids like you. You'll surely be accepted as a full-time staff member. You'll make a good guard for the kids as well. This peculiar madness sounds too scary. We don't want you to run the risk of getting infected."\n"Alright! Don't worry, so long as I'm here, I'll keep them safe and sound."
251058=In the wake of the apocalypse, five-year-old Christine and her younger sister Tikka were abandoned by their cruel parents as "burdensome twins." They had no choice but to seek help from passers-by to get some food; the roaming zombies only added to the difficulty of living. After being deceived many times and almost sold by a "good-hearted man", they finally decided not to trust anyone anymore. As a result, they started to scavenge for garbage to make a living.\nAt night, a few huffs and puffs came from the deserted human neighborhood. It was little Tikka who huddled up, clutching only half of a cookie left in her hand, regardless of her rumbling stomach, and waiting for Christine to come back.\n"Ahh...My stomach is rumbling again... No. I gotta wait for Christine no matter what."\nLittle Tikka buried her head between her legs and stroked her empty stomach, as if the comforting gesture could help her resist the temptation of food. Finally, several hours later, she heard a noise from outside the door, and Christine, holding half a hare and a handful of vegetables, appeared.\n"Tikka, I know you must be starving. Sorry, that's all I found today."\n"Stop saying that. You are obviously super good at hunting! See! What a big hare you got." Seeing Christine, Tikka regained energy instantly. She took the food from Christine and shoved the cookie she had saved into Christine's mouth. \n"Alright. Now sit down and have this. Leave all the rest to me! A super delicious dish will be served in half an hour!"\n"I'll wait for the dish cooked by the great chef then." Christine sat aside to make some room for Tikka. She then began to savor the half of cookie slowly. She knew that it was what Tikka especially saved for her; if she refused her, she wouldn't eat anything first without her presence.\nMeanwhile, Tikka took out her sharpened stone knife and dissected the hare. The bloodstained fur could be cleaned up to make a coat; the inedible part could be used as bait for dogs and rats. The guts of the animal, which were something they hated before the apocalypse, were cooked with vegetables over a high heat, making the two little girls forget what they looked like. Despite her young age, Tikka had developed a knack for turning any ingredient into a delicious meal over the harsh days of the apocalypse.\nSoon, the aroma of food came out from the ruins. They two sat in front of the small campfire and started eating the food. Even the lonely night became a little more cozy because they still had each other. Little Tikka rubbed up against Christine, leaning her head on Christine's shoulder and muttering in a low voice. \n"Christine, are we going to survive in the wilderness like this for the rest of our lives?" It was only at this moment that Tikka would show the bewilderment and curiosity of a child.\n"No. By the time we find a safer place to stay, we'll settle down."\n"Is it really possible to find such a place? Those bad people out there only want to take advantage of us to make money for 'em."\n"We'll find one soon, Tikka."
251059=When people of the community who had a long day finally finished their work and pushed open the door of the bar, Christine's sweet voice and warm smile could always sweep away their fatigue, and make them chill out despite the suffering and pain.\n"Welcome to the Sweetheart Bar! What would you like to have today, sir?"\n"Gimme a glass of your specialty! I gotta celebrate the big day today!"\n"Sure, a moment please."\nAgainst the lively music in the bar, Christine started to make the drink. The mixer was bouncing up and down in her hands, with ice cubes colliding with each other and making a regular percussive sound, like a beat added to the music. As the song ended, Christine tossed the mixer upward, which leaped several times in the air, and landed precisely in the hands of Christine, who was in an inviting pose. \n"Sir, your Manhattan is ready, have a wonderful night," Christine said sweetly, shoving the orange-colored drink in front of her guest.\n"Thanx!" Benson took the glass with one hand and gulped the drink down, "I mean I've had so many drinks in so many bars, yours is still the best."\n"Thank you, sir. You are really in a good mood today. Any good news that I can celebrate with you?"\nChristine refilled the drink for Benson while inquiring about the information. Inside the bartending utensil attached to her waist, a recorder was emitting a faint red light, which meant it was recording every word in real-time. Under the effect of the highly concentrated spirit added by Christine, Benson, who was in a cheerful mood, couldn't help but boast about his recent findings. \n"I've been searching for the energy ore for years. Finally, I know where it is. It's a big day in my life, cuz when I have the ore, everyone gotta obey me!"\n"Energy ore, what is that? I've never heard of it before."\n"It's a treasure, babe! With the ore, you can get high-powered weapons functioning. And I found it before Zeus Group did. This time, I'll see who dares steal it from me. Nope, I gotta start mining tomorrow morning, in case anything happens..." Benson visualized the scene of his promotion and unrivaled status after getting the ore. He was somewhat unable to sit still and wobbled to get up. \n"You're leaving, sir? See you soon. Feel free to come back if you have time." Christine handed over the weapon to Benson while lifting one hand to stick a mini-monitor between the seams of his weapon. \n"Energy ore? That's an excellent intel... I'll have to report it to Cara now."
251060="Intel shows Zeus Group's A-S1 human lab is right below the ruins ahead. Get ready. If we can break in one minute earlier, those innocent experimental subjects could be saved one minute earlier." Coleman, head of the rescue team, signaled his men to take cover, while he hid behind a broken wall closest to the lab with a giant siege hammer in hand.\n"Recon squad ready!"\n"Medic squad ready!"\n"..."\nThanks to the well-organized management of the Minutemen, everyone responded promptly and got into their positions. As the last squad responded, Coleman took the lead with his siege hammer, which was as tall as half a man. He slammed it into the door of the lab; the thunderous sound was like a war horn. It smashed the iron door, and at the same time, made the researchers inside panicked.\n"Who did this? Darn it, where are the guards?!" A researcher who was incapable of fighting back bent down to reach the alarm button.\n"Heh! What are you doin'?" Coleman immediately noticed him and stopped him by grasping his hands behind his back and pushing him against the table, "How many kids did you capture from the community? You did the human experiments, huh? Bastard! Where are they? Gimme the key NOW!"\n"W-wait. I don't understand. We don't have...ouch...kids here." Obviously, the researcher wouldn't confess this easily.\n"Captain! Something's wrong with the wall. It might be empty inside."\n"Lemme see it!" Coleman stopped wasting time with the researcher and left him to his men. He then lifted the hammer with one hand and smashed it towards the wall.\nFollowing a loud rumble, the bricks were shattered and fell, revealing the skinny children squatting inside. When sunlight finally shone into the dark room, the children, who had been frightened for days, cried out loud. Coleman held the youngest one and soothed him with a gentle look that was very different from how he usually looked like.\n"It's alright now, boy. Minutemen will send y'all home, okay?"
251061="Signs of life detected in the northwest; requesting backup." \n"Roger, on my way!" Alisa, who arrived immediately, started to configure her rescue equipment and anxiously stared at the girl in the rubble who was showing faint signs of life. \n"Wake up, are you still with me? Hold on, we'll get you out." \nThe light from the flashlight shone through the gaps between the rubble and landed on Kobayakawa's face, causing her to frown. Finally, she regained her consciousness. Before she cleared up her thoughts, the inquiries of the people sounded over her. As she was unable to unpack so much info in a short time, the sounds were like noises from a radio to her, intermittent and unintelligible. \n"Ahh... So noisy." \n"Great, she is still conscious! Move faster." \n"Wait, the rock is way too big. How do we lift it?" \n"There are too many obstacles around here; the rock crusher can't get in." \n"Damn, her head is still bleeding. What should we do? Wait, the rock is shaking!" \n"...a rock? Move it away then." \nKobayakawa could finally figure out what was going on around her. She tried to sit up and grabbed one end of the stone slate with her hands, and lifted it as if throwing a quilt. The rescue team was utterly stunned by her force. \n"Geez, what kind of power is this!" \nAmidst the awe of the squad, Alisa walked up to Kobayakawa and looked at the serial number tattoo on her wrist - the unique mark of the Zeus Group's "experimental body." She came to realize that the rescue operation that had been lasting for weeks had finally come to a breakthrough. \n"Inform Mr. Bolton that we've found a survivor from the experiment." said Alisa, who held Kobayakawa in her arms and soothed her: \n"Sorry for taking this long to get you out. Minutemen will take you home soon." \nThe warm embrace that she had never experienced before left Kobayakawa at a loss. The strange word lingered in her mind: "Home? What would home be like?" She couldn't help but envision the place.

255055=Looks like this is the place. Geez, with the tech here, we can live as if we were back on the surface!
255056=Provided that you find the required materials first.
255057=We can unlock even more functions once the Control Center reaches Lv. 3!
255058=More and more people would join us by then.
255059=Let's expand the Diner first to welcome our new friends.
255060=Now that we have training camps, we can train our residents into soldiers!
255061=I can't wait to exterminate the zombies outside
255062=Gee Whiz, we have so many facilities now!
255063=All facilities are currently operating at low efficiency. We should find a way to move them.
255064=I think you're talking about the Control Center's Edit function.
255065=This mine looks quite rich in resouces
255066=Now that we have Iron, we can construct even more facilities.
255067=You guys seem to be well stocked. I have a feeling we're gonna be great trade buddies!
255068=I've issued a Survival Challenge to all my clients. Complete the various challenges to receive fantastic rewards from me!
255069=See these wonderful items? All of them can be yours, as long as you complete the challenges!
255070=Gain points for every completed Challenge Mission. Rewards can be claimed when accumulated points reach its corresponding number.
255071=Here are some points to get you started! Go and claim your first reward now!
255072=These rewards aren't bad eh? Next up are the Challenge Missions I issued.
255073=Challenge Missions are divided into 2 types: Season Challenges and Time-limited Challenges.
255074=2 Time-limited Challenge Missions will refresh daily, each lasting 3 days. They will be replaced with new challenges if they are not completed within the 3 days.
255075=Season Challenge Missions last the entire season. You can complete them at any time during the season, but each mission can only be completed once.
255076=Please remember to manually claim the points after completing missions.
255077=In addition to Survival Challenge Missions, Challenge Points can be also be obtained from completing daily activities such as excavations, constructions, explorations, etc.
255078=In short, go all out and complete the Survival Challenge Missions, my dear clients!
255079=Let's leave some <color=#E5133B>Gopher Traps</color> at the entrance of those holes, and then simply wait for them to walk into the trap.
255080=<color=#E5131B>Ingredients</color> prepared. Now to hand them to Emma.
255081=Awesome! Seems there are tons of Stone hidden here!
255082=The <color=#E5131B>Quarry</color> is accessible. Now all we need is some miners.
255083=Hmm... the vehicles to rescue the Survivors should be back soon!
255084=Excavate along the indicated route and see what you find.
255085=Hey, McKinley. I know you won't leave us behind.
255086=Please let us stay, we're capable of handling many tasks.
255087=Guys, our Ore Output has increased dramatically. It's time to upgrade the Entrance Hall!
255088=Thanks to our new friends. As long as you work hard, you'll have a roof over your head and food on the table.
255089=Try to Speed Up to reduce time for construction & upgrade!
255090=Choose <color=#E5131B>Mechatronics</color> to research!
255091=Wow, the lady's bedroom has a back door! Brady, when did you do this?
255092=Don't be silly! It's apparently a door reserved for the Fortress, presumably it's to be used for emergency.
255093=The device next to it should be the door switch. Just try it.
255094=From now on, we'll be able to connect the two areas directly with the Quarters.
255095=The gophers are ready. We need water to make the gopher soup.

256001=Day {0}
256002=Tap the <color=#FD5E00>button</color> to investigate
256003=Tap the <color=#FD5E00>point of aim</color> to shoot
258001=There are too many zombies here. Exterminate them so we can scavenge for resources here in peace.
258002=Press on the Hero to deploy them into the formation
258003=Ready! Let's roll out!
258004=In normal attacks, the front row of enemy will be the default target. The ones launching attacks and being attacked will both gain some Focus.
258005=We've purged this area of zombies and established a camp.
258006=We'll begin scavenging for resources and store them in the camp for you to collect at any time. The more zombies you exterminate, the faster we can scavenge.
258007=Now let's take a look at the camp
258008=Here you can check on the supplies that we've scavenged, as well as our scavenging speed.
258009=We have a new companion now. Press on their icon to set them into the formation.
258010=You can drag and drop to adjust our positions in the formation.
258011=Each Stage you clear will increase Exploration Efficiency.
258012=We found an Production Recruitment Ticket. Now we can go to the Satellite Nexus and search for a suitable companion!
258013=Some Heroes are available for Ascending. Go check them out!
258014=Heroes can be Ascended here. Ascending Heroes will raise their level cap, increase their attributes, and may even give them new skills!
258015=Drag and drop facilities to change their location
258016=Heroes that are in good moods perform better
258017=Heroes in bad moods perform worse
258018=I guarantee you. There's no better place than here. Gigantic crates filled to the brim with valuable resources are just waiting for you!
258019=But would you look at these zombies. They won't even let you work!
258020=Anyone who stands in my way will be worse off than a zombie!
258021=Relatively speaking, the enemies here are weak, yet the resources are quite abundant.
258022=You'll believe it when you see it! I'll take you there whenever you want!
258023=Well, we can't exactly move all those supplies with just our bare hands.
258024=Oh! I know a place filled with abandoned vehicles. Maybe one of them is functional. Wait here!
258025=Ok. I'll wait here.
258026=Rapid Production can be very useful when it comes to generating Power in a short period of time
258027=So what are we waiting for?
258028=Yes, the Power Generator's Rapid Production can produce a certain amount of Power, but we need to research "Temperature Modulation" first.
258029=We have enough Power now. Let's try starting up this big boy
258030=We consumed too much in one go! We're running out of Power! What do we do?
258031=It's okay, I have an idea
258032=I saw a "Rapid" button on the Power Generator just now. I'm guessing it'll help us obtain Power even quicker
258033=Well, the instructions do say that "Temperature Modulation" should be researched before use. Otherwise, the machine will overheat.
258034=Lemme see that! Gosh! I didn't expect this big guy to eat up that much Power! Sure are in a pickle now...
258035=Maybe we can try out the Rapid mode? I saw it in action just now at the Power Generator
258036=Hey fellas, a newcomer from the [Solari] faction has just joined us
258037=I heard people from this faction were once really good at infrastructure construction
258038=Let's take a look at what Richard is good at
258039=He's a professional electrician who can help us increase our Power Production Rate
258040=But we don't have a machine that can generate Power yet...
258041=Well, I guess we can arrange for him to do some other work first
258042=Hey Diana! Welcome to the team!
258043=Your appearance alone just screams "knowledgeable". What do you specialize in?
258044=I'm a geological researcher. Honestly, living underground has always been a dream of mine, as it's where I can truly shine.
258045=Sounds like you're the perfect person to supervise the Stone Quarry then! We gonna need lots more Stone to develop our Fortress.
258046=We've recruited another [Solari] Hero! Let's assign them to work at the Iron Mine
258047=Even though Jack Chang has never worked in a mine before, his dexterity will help him out quite a bit.
258048=You can also enter Management Mode by zooming out to quickly reassign Workers.
258049=Different modes can be switched here as well
258050=Drag the screen to exit Management mode
258051=You gotta do everything you can if you want to continue living!
258052=I'm hungry, dizzy, and in no mood to do any work.
258053=I wanna eat and sleep, but work must go on...
258054=I haven't had a belly full of food in nearly two months. I don't know how long I can continue going on like this.
258055=Someone's bound to run away if the food shortage continues.
258056=I'm an expert on this!
258057=With this heavy machine gun in hand, no amount of zombies'll pose a threat!
258058=Stop rushing us man. Show a little compassion to someone with a hand injury!
258059=You want me to work harder? Then give me a reason to!
258060=See? Even I understand it's pointless being urgent about these things.
258061=If only we had some tomatoes...I'm starting to crave for a bowl of hot tomato soup.
258062=This taste...and texture...the only word I have for it is bizarre.
258063=I guess you guys are right, I should just be grateful to have something edible at all...
258064=Oh ho! Who could refuse such a thing! Thanks!
258065=Not bad, at least I'm feeling better than before.
258066=Thank you so much! I feel so lively now! Shall I sing a song for you?
258067=Nice! I'll return the favor someday!
258068=Oh my, you're literally my savior! Thank you.
258069=Erm, I'm not exactly good at fancy talk...but...thanks...
258070=Well, doing something is better than just waiting to die I guess...
258071=Phew, I think I'm feeling a bit peckish...
258072=Is there no use for me as an expert?
258073=Is this good enough?
258074=There sure isn't a shortage of things to do around here.
258075=I need to work harder!
258076=I'm so hungry...
258077=I have to say, I'm about done with this...
258078=I needa take a breather...
258079=Got it, I'll get to that later.
258080=Is it urgent?
258081=Ever heard the phrase "work smart, not hard"? Maybe you should think about upgrading our tools instead of rushing us to work faster!
258082=I'd say not too bad.
258083=My expectations were already low, yet I was still disappointed. Can we please add some more spices in the future?
258084=Looks like the food problem is far more serious than anticipated.
258085=Quite effective.
258086=Roger that!
258087=That's that.
258088=Let me continue my work.
258089=Much better.
258090=Situation's turning for the better!
258091=Well, things are not that bad here.
258092=Make sure folks are workin' in a good mood
258093=You'd better keep working, unless you wanna be thrown out to feed zombies
258094=This should last a while.
258095=This place needs to be checked out again.
258096=Well, not much we can do about it now.
258097=I've nothing to say. Leave me alone.
258098=What more do you want from me? Just leave me be.
258099=Think of something. Anything. Just please solve this problem.
258100=I'll deliver a few more times, don't you worry about it.
258101=I've already told you, I'll get it done.
258102=Go do something else and stop breathing down my neck would you?
258103=Stop complaining, having something to eat is good enough already.
258104=This honestly isn't too bad!
258105=That was satisfying! All that's missing is some greens now.
258106=Not bad! I feel much lighter on my feet now!
258107=Thanks! Didn't expect that from you.
258108=You've helped me a lot! Lemme do somethin' for you as well!
258109=Wonderful! Let's grab a drink when we're done with work!
258110=I'm feeling much better, thank you.
258111=I'm saved! Thank you!
258112=Working and getting paid with food is much better than starving to death!
258113=*Cough*...I swear if someone farts in here we'll all suffocate to death.
258114=Leave it to me, you go play with the zombies.
258115=There, that's that I guess.
258116=And that's how the cookie crumbles.
258117=Finally, something to eat!
258118=Let me know if you can't do these things properly.
258119=No food on my fork, no mood for work!
258120=Can't you go solve some of our troubles?
258121=Gotta work to survive!
258122=I gotta recall how I used to <color=#E5131B>cook</color> in the past.
258123=With the Work Station, we can start to <color=#E5131B>excavate</color> and <color=#E5131B>construct</color> something.
258124=Everyone's starving! We must go find something to eat.
258125=Built-in radar on. We’ll have the destination locked first.
258126=Five miles to the southwest... Destination locked! Let's go.
258127=<color=#E5131B>WARNING! WARNING!</color> This is a <color=#E5131B>Mutated</color> Zombie. They are much stronger than normal zombies!
258128=We must unite allies together for a <color=#E5131B>Rally Attack</color>. Your units won't stand a chance alone!
258129=Kill Mutated Zombies to obtain large amounts of <color=#E5131B>Z Coins</color> and <color=#E5131B>Recruitment Points</color>. Start a <color=#E5131B>Rally</color> now!
258130=Trying to expand and survive alone in a world infested with zombies isn't a wise decision!
258131=<color=#E5131B>Relocate</color> close to another ally for a safer environment!
258132=We can use the various free Relocation items every day
258133=Use <color=#E5131B>Alliance Relocations</color> to relocate close to the Alliance Leader!
258134=Time to show up! or tomorrow?
258135=Many facilities are half-paralyzed, and repairing them will unlock more functions.
258137=Starting this machine requires a large amount of power, and our power storage is inadequate.
258138=Everyone is taking their own weight.
258139=Phew... Be grateful for the days when you have food.
258140=I can help more people!
258141=That's great. I can keep going!
258142=Rest? I don't need any rest.
258143=I can do much more!
258144=If I were strong enough, I could protect everyone.
258145=I need to calm down.
258146=I just want to rest...
258147=It tastes... There should be room for improvement.
258148=I feel that my cooking skill has improved again!
258149=Though I'm underground, my good mood won't go away.
258150=Food, water...what else can I help with?
258151=I deserve it, but thank you though!
258152=I can't believe that I've learned so much here.
258153=Being underground all day long... When can I get back to the ground...
258154=It's much better than dry food.
258155=It's time to practice with the Zombies.
258156=Thanks a lot.
258157=Humph, trouble will come again soon!
258158=Only with rich experience can you survive on the battlefield.
258159=Zombies? Humph, a piece of cake.
258160=I need a rest before the next wave of Zombies comes.
258161=Welcome in, Diana. I heard that you are a geologist?
258162=Yeah, Geology is my best field.
258163=Great, we do need geologists to mine the ores, so you can stay and show your capabilities.
258164=Phew... I needa have a break...
258165=Thank god I can still fill my stomach in times like these...
258166=I can do even better!
258167=As long as you stay alive, there'll be hope.
258168=I really gotta do something to keep myself busy.
258169=Some mistakes in work could've been avoided.
258170=I feel so alive right now.
258171=God knows how long the Fortress can last...
258172=Damn it. Why do I have to take so many things at once?
258173=What's that smell... Maybe I should try eating it raw. It might taste a little bit better.
258174=Next time I see Zombies, I'll be able to get away.
258175=You gotta have fun by yourself in times like these.
258176=It sucks! No entertainment at all.
258177=If you wanna survive zombie attacks, you gotta be good at summing up strategies as I do!
258178=Not a chance to catch me even in a zombie siege.
258179=Damn it. If things go on like this, we gonna be so dead!
258180=Looks like I haven't recovered to my best state yet...
258181=The taste was... hard to describe.
258182=Looks like I'm getting much better at aiming.
258183=Relax, Brom. At least you're still alive.
258184=Staying in your comfort zone is your biggest enemy nowadays.
258185=I'm getting more used to fighting against Zombies.
258186=Now I'm positive I can blow the Zombie's head off with one shot.
258187=Damn, I almost forgot what it feels like to shoot...
258188=We need more space! Upgrade the facility now.
258189=Hurry up to train before the Zombies arrive.
258190=Knowledge is power. Let's research something in the laboratory.
258191=Can I make hot tomato soup by myself?
258192=Let me help you if you have any questions!
258193=I am worthy of being a genius.
258194=Lemme see what's in the box.
258195=Worker is {0}, please wait
258196=proceeding to the investigation point
258197=proceeding to the Turret
258198=proceeding to the door
258199=The voucher cannot be used in your region due to the pricing policy of Apple Inc.
259006=Let's ask the Trader. Maybe he'll have a solution.
259007=Based on what you're describing, I've seen something similar in another fortress.
259008=The owners of such fortresses once possessed technology beyond imagination.
259009=They conducted all manners of experiments. The place you're talking about was once their testing area.
259010=Well, I have no clue what's waiting for us inside, but I think I have a way in.
259011=How can you enter to the fortress?
259012=Our Merchant Union found a similar place in an abandoned fortress. We forged a fake ID card for that particular door.
259013=Relax. This card can only open the specified door. It can't accidentally open anything dangerous.
259014=So, wanna take a look? And don't worry, the price is quite reasonable!
259015=Let's welcome the little cutie to join our team. Before that, we need to give him a name first.
259016=Spike
259017=Sam
259018=Scooby
259019=Look, Eden's shield is removed
259020=It's time to capture the place to end this endless war.
259021=Can we uncover the truth about the zombies if we capture there?
259022=It looks like Lord Fernando is going to be the "king" of Eden.
259023=Whatever is there, we must be well-prepared.
259024=Rally all alliance members and prepare for battle.
259025=The shield is back on again.
259026=However, the shield is not permanent, only effective for a few days.
259027=There is no eternal throne, my dear friend.
259028=The shield will disappear in {0} days and you cannot attack Eden until then.
259029=At the very center of Eden, there actually is --
259030=A door.
259031=The whole device emits an unusual glow.
259032=Look, there's a countdown on the screen here!
259033=What happens if the countdown goes to zero?
259034=The dry air, fishy smell and blazing sun... Where the hell is this place?
259035=Eden, not on our horizon.
259036=That door with a countdown...
259037=That's right! That must be the thing behind all the scheme!
259038=What should we do, Brady?
259039=Return to Eden! We have to find out what the secret of that door is.
259040=As a Defender, of course I'll be standing in the front row to shield the damage.
259041=As a seasoned Archer, I'll be staying away from the monster to deal damage.
259042=Now you may have a rest. While you are having a rest, the time in the Fortress will be fast-forwarded for a while.
259043=Look, the fog is receding! What is that?!
259044=Hmm... A massive construction with an eerie glow inside...
259045=Here's a letter in the corner! Better examine it later.
259046=Can this be a trap? Someone seemed to be expecting us.
259047=Another massive building?!
259048=It's like there's some kinda connection between them! They're all glowing in the same way now!
259049=I knew it. We need to find another letter.
259050=Let's keep the letters and get going. I can feel it. We're getting close to the truth!
259051=Three gigantic buildings connected somehow, each emitting a shaft of light shrouding Eden...
259052=This... This must be the last letter...
259053=...light shrouding Eden... Now, wait just a second!
259054=Quick! Bring the letters! Everyone, to Eden! Let's go!
259055=Only the one with the "key" can open the "Gate of Fate"...
260000=Round
260001=No rewards currently
260002={0}/min
260003=Exploration Time:
260004=No Heroes to deploy

270106=To avoid getting trapped or further collapsing, we best excavate carefully.
270107=Going deeper is not recommended.
270108=There is a cracking sound of a door in the distance.
270109=There is a cracking sound made by several doors in the distance.
270110=Thank god. Finally, you got rid of the zombies.
270111=Adventure is really not my thing.
270112=Give me a ride on the way back.
270113=Hey! Look, I found something. It looks like the diary of this doctor...
270114=I wonder what kind of things scientists would put down in their diaries.
270115=Let's save the people first. <b>Take a closer look</b> when time allows.
270116=Someone's Journal
270117=The journal with the name "Gustavo" on its leather paper cover, which was slightly raised. Looks like there's something beneath it.
270118="Be cautious of possible water leaks"? The place doesn't seem like it would have any water leakages.
270119=This note tucked away in the pages of the journal surely has a deeper meaning than merely warning us of water leaks.
270120=Water leakage... What is it trying to tell us?
270121=Water? How about soaking it in water?
270122=Woo! That's ingenious! I happen to have half a bottle of water here. Check this out!
270123=Hey! Don't pour that much, okay?
270124=Gustavo's Last Words
270125=Gustavo's Appointment Letter
270126=A Page of Tattered Notes
270127=Worker ID
270128=Dr. Gustavo, you have been appointed as the Director of Laboratory 31 for the purpose of conducting research on the top-secret Project Ω, effective as of x/x/1986.
270129=...the distance between the portals is very short, with a radius of only 100-300 meters in most cases. While there are some portals that can transport you up to 500km or...but they are incredibly rare to find.
270130=Name: Gustavo \nPosition: Director of Project Ω \nPermission: Highest permission for portal activation
270131=Guys! We just found a set of notes of a doctor that read...
270132=The record shows that the zombie outbreak had something to do with the Zeus Group!
270133=Dr. Gustavo placed the evidence in three different locations. This would be a great opportunity for us to unveil the astounding news!
270134=Then no more waiting. Let's start to search for evidence now!
270135=A Loose Page with Coordinates
270136=By the time you find this message, the world will have been taken by zombies. It's all part of the Zeus Group's scheme. To unveil it, I conducted an investigation and gathered some evidence, which I left in three places. The first part can be found at coordinates <color=#FD3C00>(137, 996)</color>. If you think you are able to gather all the evidence, do publish it to make it known to the entire world.
270137=Oh my! The ground is shaking intensely!
270138=I almost thought I was going to be buried here.
270139=The facilities are quite old and indeed insecure.
270140=For safety reasons, we'd better not to <b><color=#FD3C00>excavate downwards vertically</color></b>.
270141=A text entitled "Gustavo's Last Words" found inside the cover of the journal
270201=Place in Ruins
270202=Near the body, some pages were found in scrawl: \n This place was once Fortress No. 659488. Date: xx xx, xxxx; A rare seismic event occurred. \n The earthquake rendered most of the structures in ruins and caused equipment failure. \n I'm stuck and will probably die here. If anyone is reading this, be careful if you want to enter the Fortress. \n Gustavo
270203=It reads:
270204=This place was once Laboratory No. 31. Date: Nov 21, 1990; A rare seismic event occurred.
270205=The earthquake rendered most of the structures in ruins
270206=and caused equipment failure. I'm stuck and will probably die here.
270207=If anyone is reading this, be careful of possible <b><color=#FD3C00>water leaks</color></b> if you want to enter the place.
270208=Gustavo
270209=Here is a note that reads: after the rain
270210=Here is a note that reads: brief yet beautiful
270211=Here is a note that reads: an arch
270212=Here is a note that reads: not reachable
270213=The notes might tell us the order to open the doors
270214=Brady, don't tell me you end up here because you got lost...
270215=Honestly, I almost got lost. The place is like a maze.
270216=The good news is we cleared all the obstacles on the way here.
270217=Great! Don't forget to take the supplies we found.
270218=The text on the door reads: "July 12, divination result: purple". Do you want to open the door?
270219=The text on the door reads: "Sept 30, divination result: red". Do you want to open the door?
270220=The text on the door reads: "Feb 29, divination result: green". Do you want to open the door?
270221=The text on the door reads: "Nov 7, divination result: orange". Do you want to open the door?
270222=Here's a note on the door: it can be opened when all four switches are switched on
270223=How to open the door: the sum of the lucky numbers output by switches needs to be equal to the number on the door
270224=Pressing the reset button will reset the status of all doors. Continue?
270225=After some clicking sounds, all doors were reset to their initial status.
270226=The radar shows Bacchus is stuck in there.
270227=The place is quite neat, I have to say. Where do you think Bacchus is held?
270228=He said the loud <b><color=#FD3C00>colors</color></b> here got on his nerves. He was just trying to take a scroll, but ended up being stuck here.
270229=Colors? All I can see is some crumpled paper.
270230=That's weird. The <b><color=#FD3C00>paper</color></b> shouldn't have been left here. Why did the cleaner miss it?
270231=Lemme see what's written on it.
270232=I really can't get what these words are trying to explain.
270233=Why Gustavo had to speak like a riddler all the time...
270234=Since when did scientists start to communicate in such a weird way?
270235=You should thank him for not leaving a tricky puzzle.
270236="After the rain; an arch; mesmerizing"...Is that a rainbow?
270237=Looks like scientists have weaknesses too, just like I do. Ha-ha.
270238=Then let's try to open the doors <b><color=#FD3C00>in the order of the color of a rainbow</color></b>!
270239=Watch out! This zombie looks much more powerful than what we met before.
270240=Of course. Obviously, it looks different from all the other ones!
270241=Natalie, HELP!
270242=Four clues are hidden separately near the entrance of the mine.
270243=Note under the cart
270244=Note on the pick
270245=Note hidden in a haste
270246=Note on the ceiling
270247=Why does the Zeus Group study the zombie virus? Turning the world into an apocalypse is definitely a less desirable situation for those capitalists. What could be the real reason? Are they trying to cover up their research on the portal? But the portal can only transport some objects. Is it worth the heavy doses of money spent on it? Another possibility left would be...the portal can do much more things than what we know!
270248=The Zeus Group deliberately built their portal research facilities at multiple locations and banned any communication between them. Shortly after I began investigating the nearby facilities, the Zeus Group noticed my activities. That's why I had to run away from them. If anyone happens to find this message, please continue the investigation into their secret base located at (397,233). — Gustavo
270249=On the note is a to-do list scrawled by someone. Looks like it was hidden by that person in a haste.\n<b>1. Rescue the technician held by the Zeus Group. \n2. Locate the prototype of the zombie virus. \n3. Find Dr. Gallo.</b>\nThese are the three key things to do before we can uncover the conspiracy of the Zeus Group.
270250=A paper with many coordinates on it. Most of them were crossed off, while one coordinate was circled with a question mark next to it, which means Gustavo has not explored that place yet. Will Dr. Gallo be there at the moment?
270251=Crumpled Note
270288=1. Try to collect all resources and rescue the heroes.\n2. Try to excavate the Blocks to clear the way.\n3. If the door is closed, try to find where the switch is.
270301=Power Surge
270302=The power facility is repaired. I have the Drawing. But there's a problem with the circuit. The door switches are mismatched.
270303=Does it mean one switch can open multiple doors?
270304=Or close them. We'd better be careful.
270305=We found another deserted Fortress.
270306=Look around to see if we can find anything useful.
270307=It's dark here. We need to find the power facility first.
270308=Hmm...easy peasy. Leave it to me. An expert like me won't let you down!
270309=Lemme see... Judging from the wires, the power facility should be...right here!
270310=Ha-ha, I told you I'm a genius! Voila! Here comes the power!
270311=Great job! The location system is back online. The signal indicates that Pamela is trapped inside.
270312=Caution! <color=#FD3C00>Dangerous facility on the right</color>. KEEP AWAY!
270313=Seriously? Why would anyone leave a lab facility in such a secret place?!
270314=The door slid open. A round mechanical door of double the average height of a man was revealed.
270315=What's this? It reads..."Ω-2".
270316=Ω? I saw the sign before. In the...in that document about Ω!
270317=If I'm not mistaken, Ω was the project Dr. Gustavo was working on.
270318=That is to say, what we see right now is the portal mentioned in the experiment log?
270319=Woo! That's dope, guys! With the portal, I can go anywhere in a blink of an eye!
270320=Don't get excited so soon. Obviously, it's not functioning. Here's a note that reads:
270321="Small portal Ω-2; teleport range 300-500m". I'm afraid your wish is not gonna come true this time.
270322=Hell no...
270323=Application for more power facilities
270324=Application for more power facilities in lab 35: \nAs we carry out the Ω-2 project, we found that the power cost was much more than what we expected. Specifically, 7KW of power can be consumed in a single experiment. Due to the shortage of power, we can only carry out the experiment every two weeks, which was not enough for us to continue the research. We need two power generators and one power storage facility. This issue is quite urgent. Please reply as soon as possible. \n— Dr. G.
270325=Ω-Aurora Excavation Project
270326=A document bag labeled "top secret" had its seal torn. Looks like someone had taken the document out to read it. The document was about the excavation site of a large portal ruin, with some keywords being circled. Were the marks left by Dr. Gustavo?
270327=Gustavo's Journal II
270328=xx/xx/1982\nAfter talking to Gallo, I started to keep an eye on the whereabouts of my colleagues in the same project. I realized that most of the colleagues who joined the team in the same year as me already left the project.\nLater, I learned that the reason they left was that they were dispatched to some other projects or they had personal issues to handle.\nThe weird thing was even their family members could not get in touch with them. The Zeus Group must have some secrets that I've not found out yet.
270329=Review of the small portal's performance
270330=1. Power required: 40W~200W. \n2. We previously thought the obstacles would increase power consumption, but the result showed that the impact of the obstacles between the start point and the destination was negligible. The power consumption of the teleport is proportional to the distance traveled. \n3. The maximum teleportation radius for Ω-1 small portal is around 300 meters. \n4. Small obstacles such as garbage cans, foam blocks, and plastic balls near the destination will be pushed aside by the teleported object. In the case of obstacles exceeding 1m³ or more than 10kg, however, the teleport will fail.
270331=Next Clue
270332=Based on the pattern indicated by the first two clues, we soon figured out the coordinates (254, 765) from the document about the Ω-Aurora Excavation Project. The circled hint was a bit confusing, though. Gustavo wrote at the end of the project document: "I look forward to the world being restored to its once <b><color=#FD3C00>lovely and clean state</color></b>."
270388=1. The switch can work only after the deserted Work Station is fixed.\n2. The switches here are used to open/close multiple doors. Explore as many places as you can.
270401=Here's a number next to the switch: 8
270402=Here's a number next to the switch: 4
270403=Here's a number next to the switch: 2
270404=Here's a number next to the switch: 1
270405=Here's a number next to the door: 2
270406=Here's a number next to the door: 13
270407=Here's a number next to the door: 7
270408=The layout here is a mess.
270409=I'm here to look for the supplies in the mines.
270410=Never expected that the excavation led to a cave-in, which is why I'm stuck here.
270411=Thank god. I didn't come down here earlier. We took away some deposits piled up out there.
270412=I guess you're referring to the deposits I mined earlier. Nothing's left here. Let's leave now.
270413=Looks like you noticed the tips I left next to the switches up there.
270414=I almost made it to get these damn doors open.
270415=I'd rather train a thousand rookies than look for the stuff those people left here.
270416=Lucky Number
270417=After the Rain
270418=1. Try to collect all resources and rescue the hero.\n2. The lucky number on the door is the key! Use the switch to complete the lucky number and the door will open!
270419=Hello? Hello! Anybody there?
270420=Damn, the signal of the walkie-talkie is even weaker after the facility collapsed.
270421=Lori, can you hear us? Where are you?
270422=Great, it's Brady!
270423=I'm not quite sure where I am. I remember that I changed the <b><color=#FD3C00>digits</color></b> on the door and ended up getting stuck here.
270424=Digits? Stay where you are. We'll find a way to get there!
270425=There are a few numbers on the <b><color=#FD3C00>notice board</color></b> ahead. Do they have anything to do with all this?
270426=Let's give it a go then.
270427=Document on Top Secret Project φ
270428=Gallo's appointment letter: Dr. Gallo, you are now appointed as the Director of Laboratory 382, responsible for the research on human body boosting potions, with the project name being "φ". x/x/1965
270429=Report of an Abnormal Case
270430=In the report, certain text is stained with blood, and a few spots are circled by blood as if someone did it intentionally.
270431=xx/xx/1982. Experiment No. 04. Record of injection #<color=#FD3C00>163</color>. \nInjected: φ-B-404
270432=Experimental record: 3 hours after the injection, the test subject began to exhibit signs of emotional instability and tried to attack the living creature placed in its cage.
270433=5 hours after the injection, the test subject showed a decreased perception of pain.
270434=The test subject was put under the <color=#FD3C00>electric shock</color> of 50, 100, and 200 volts, but it did not stop attacking even when it lost consciousness.
270435=6 hours after the injection, the test subject regained consciousness and started gnawing at the dead creature inside its cage.
270436=To test whether the potion could actually help the human body "repair" itself, amputations were conducted on the test subject without anesthesia.
270437=The findings showed that the healing rate of the wounds was 10.7 times faster than usual, which met the experiment's expectations.
270438=Result: The potion φ-B-<color=#FD3C00>404</color> has been approved for further research.
270439=Recorder
270440=An old-fashioned recorder, which appears to be pretty old. It stores a recording.
270441=Gustavo, finally you are here. I was worried that you failed to receive the message.
270442=Researchers from different projects are not permitted to have private talks. I believe you know the regulation well.
270443=Now tell me, what is the thing that made you reach out to me regardless of the regulation?
270444=I found that there may be hidden secrets behind Zeus Group's research.
270445=They were secretly conducting inhumane experiments on humans. The so-called boosting potion for humans was a pretext to cover their real purpose.
270446=Another strange thing was they gathered the test subjects of all secret projects recently. Looks like they're planning on a major operation.
270447=Gustavo, I need your help this time. Help me collect more evidence!
270448=I see. I know you wouldn't make a conclusion without enough evidence, Gallo. I'll be looking into Ω now.
270449=If they were really doing something immoral, I wouldn't allow the project to continue as planned.
270450=You gotta be careful, man.
270451=Taking a closer look at the circled text in the report, you will see three keywords: <b><color=#FD3C00>163, 404, and electric shock</color></b>.
270452=The four switches from left to right are 8, 4, 2, and 1 respectively.
270501=Teleportation Device
270502=1. Try to collect all resources, rescue the hero stuck here and leave the place.\n2. The symbol on the switch of the portal seems to be a hint.
270503=We got it. This is a copy of the φ vaccine developed by Dr. Gallo.
270504=We came at good timing. There are not many guards around here. Let's leave the place now.
270505=But the door on the way is shut now. We have to go through the area to find another exit.
270506=To curb the zombie virus, the rooms are all separated from each other. We can navigate through a special teleport device.
270507=Now we can only try our best to move on.
270508=Geez! Is that you, Fernando?
270509=Bacchus? Why are you here?
270510=It's a long story. Do you know how to get out?
270511=We're also looking for a way out. Come with us.
270512=Thank god! We left the place!
270513=Finally, I can take a deep breath of fresh air. I almost suffocated in those little cells!
270514=It's not the time for complaining, gents. We gotta leave here now.
270515=Warning! An unregistered visitor is trying to activate the portal! Warning protocol triggered!
270516=Investigation Order of Project φ
270517=A thorough investigation will be conducted regarding the report of Dr. Gallo's suspected misconduct. Dr. Gallo will now be removed from the position of project head, with his access to research samples suspended.
270518=Activation of Early Warning Protocol
270519=To secure the lab and stop outsiders from stealing the classified info, a protocol for early warning has been created: once the portal is illegally activated, all doors in the lab will open automatically to exterminate the outsiders AT ALL COSTS.
270520=Excavation instance -{0}
271001=Season exploration reset
271002=Welcome to the new season! The exploration zones have been reset, with both the difficulty and rewards increased significantly. Rewards not claimed in time in the previous season have been sent to your mail. Be sure to collect them. Keep up the good work in the new season!
271003=Season to be reset

280000=If it's difficult to complete <color=#FFD700>key missions</color>, you may start from <color=#FFD700>normal missions</color>.
280001=When resources are insufficient, you may check if there are any unused <color=#FFD700>resources</color> in <color=#FFD700>Item</color>.
280002=In a war, using Relocation will <color=#FFD700>make battles happen immediately</color>.
280003=Check out recent popular events in the <color=#FFD700>Event Center</color>
280004=When a failure occurs, you can <color=#FFD700>Contact Customer Service</color>
280005=When marching, put Defenders in the <color=#FFD700>front row</color> to increase the chance to win.
280006=Research the tech, <color=#FFD700>Deployment Queue</color>, to increase the number of Heroes that can be deployed.

316320="The task of today has been completed with a total of 1,342 Easter eggs have been delivered." \n "Thank you for your hard work, N.A.T.E. Come, for your Easter gift – a special edition of Easter egg by Emma." Brady handed the gift to N.A.T.E yet he didn’t take it like he usually would. \n "N.A.T.E?" \nN.A.T.E heard that Easter eggs can hatch rabbits. N.A.T.E is a machine and therefore not suitable for caring for living things.” \n “It’s just a fairy tale," Brady smiled and put the egg in N.A.T.E's hands, “Yet I believe you will get a new life and become a living person with this Easter egg.” \n "N.A.T.E, alive... the data analysis failed... yet N.A.T.E is looking forward to it”
316321=Recently, Natalie seemed not herself as she was hiding in the house all day. Emma observed for many days and noticed Natalie’s paint-stained hands. It turned out that Natalie was practising drawing on eggs secretly. \n"Unexpectedly, it turns out that Natalie also has things that she’s not good at. "\nEmma looked through the crack of the door at Natalie's hands, which were steady when aiming at zombies yet clumsy at drawing, putting drawings that were hard to recognize on the eggs. Emma sneered a few times with her mouth covered and took a photo to keep as a souvenir.
316322=The entire fortress is surrounded by various Easter eggs drawn by everyone as Easter is approaching. They were hoping to receive the blessing from the Goddess of Life today, so that they could farewell the Apocalypse and greet their new beginnings. \nBrady sat in a quiet corner, staring at the crowd celebrating the holiday. He would never imagine he would come across and celebrate a holiday with a group of people one day. \nUnfortunately, his wife and daughter didn’t have the chance to see today for themselves. \n Eggs blocked Brady's sight and Natalie appeared in front of him out of the blue, “It’s for you." \n"I am in my forties and too old for this kind of gift that makes children happy." Brady waved his hand, the colourful eggs are simply incompatible with his mature appearance. \n"It's not to make children happy, rather, a blessing.” Natalie's tone is serious, "I wish the living health, and I also wish the dead...rest in peace." \n“...Thank you." Brady took the egg, and the bitterness on the tip of his tongue was slightly covered by the sweetness of the melted candy."
316323=In the kitchen, Emma was thinking about how to make eggs with the only ingredients available at the end of the world. A round figure sneaked into the kitchen and stretched out his hand towards the cutting board. \n "Fernando, you want to steal food again! "Emma patted Fernando's hand away angrily, and a black thing fell out. \n"This is... chocolate? ！ "\n"Hey, this is my last collection. "Fernando shook his big belly and said proudly: "To hold back from eating it, I have lost a little weight."\n"I really didn't notice it. "Emma looked at Fernando up and down: ”Then what are you doing in the kitchen, showing off how precious your collection is?" "\nFernando didn't understand Emma's sarcasm, and put the chocolate next to the eggshell: "I heard that you are making Easter eggs. What could be more suitable than chocolate~ After all, food is delicious. You still have to enjoy it together. Delicious." \nThe Easter limited menu was successfully launched, and people were surprised to find that the name Fernando was added to the list of cooking chefs.
316324="Keyword extraction... Easter. Entry analysis..., encounter an unknown entry, trying to decipher. "\n" Fernando, what is Easter? "\n Fernando patted his belly, "Easter is all about having all-you-can-eat Easter eggs! "\n" Emma, what is Easter? "\n Emma washed her hands full of paint, "It’s about taking a day to draw on an egg.” \n"Natalie, what is Easter? "\n Natalie hid the badly painted egg behind her, "Um...to work." \n "To eat, to draw, to work... Analysis failed, the analysis failed,” the three completely irrelevant answers confusing N.A.T.E's data.\n"N.A.T.E, what's wrong with you?" \n"Brady, what is Easter? The answers that were given by everyone were different I can't comprehend them."\n After listening to the answers N.A.T.E collected from everyone, Brady laughed and took Nat to the lively hall. In the hall, everyone performed their duties and arranged the event venue, but there were always smiles on their faces. \n"The answers are all part of Easter, but the most important thing is that they can make everyone feel happy in these processes and rekindle their expectations for the future. "\n" entry included... Easter, a festival to welcome hope"
316325=On Easter Night, everyone exchanged gifts with each other. Either a can of canned food or a piece of clothing, common daily necessities in ordinary times, are packaged as gifts for others, they are given special value. \nUnfortunately, the cheerful exchange of gifts seemed to have nothing to do with Natalie, who was cold and silent. She rarely communicated with other people in the fortress. There was no one she could call a friend. She walked through the crowd in silence and returned to her room. \n "Happy Easter! "As soon as she opened the door, Natalie was so frightened by the sudden sound of fireworks that she almost reflexively picked up the gun. Brady, Fernando, and Emma were all in the house, holding gifts to congratulate Natalie. \n Natalie was suddenly at a loss. She turned her head to hide her strange expression, but her red ears betrayed her. \n"Thank you... my friends."

321138=The order of the old world did not last for too long. With the corrosive poison gas appearing out of nowhere, we had no choice but to find a new shelter again.\nAs is displayed on the terminal of the portal, the competitors we met before already left. Yet two more groups of survivors are heading towards the same destination as we do. This time, we come prepared. Can we make it to take the lead in the new world?

321140=Opening our eyes after an inexplicable dizzy feeling, we went through the portal and arrived at the new world! Soon, we noticed a strange Facility shrouded by the toxic gas. Many survivors are heading that way. We have to go now to see what secret could be stored in it.

323002=Ruins of Eden
323003=Having studied the remaining technology in the Doomsday Laboratory, we learned more secrets of Eden. \nEden is not the only place where unknown civilizations were born. Other cultures also left their marks on the world that might help us get close to the truth. With the reboot program on the horizon, we must race against the clock to record more files. \nAmong the findings, we spotted a name of an unknown civilization — Nibiru.
323004=We no longer fumbled in the dark now. Terminal operations revealed the two other sites of the Ruins of Eden — the Ruins of Nibiru, to be precise, which we figured out a way to enter. \nThere must be something we were looking for in these ruins.
323005=Time left its traces on every surface of the walls, marking the forsaken state of the ruins. Some machines were still there, roaming what remained, giving us hope to find what we needed.
323006=The gift from the Doomsday Laboratory made it so much easier for survivors to embrace the challenge Eden has to offer.
323007=As Eden unfolded its secret before us, the unprecedented grand remnants of the ancient past hove into sight.

324019=Things have gotten out of control, and what we worry about the most has happened...\nBut the Zeus group doesn't seem to intend to explain the disaster to the world. \nWe are locked here, guarding and building these huge technological buildings in shifts day and night. \nThey are running away, and we are apologizing...\nMy Lord, I repent to you...\nPlease bless my old friend, Dr. Bruce, who was locked up. His arms grow devilish spikes now.\nCan humanity still be saved...
324020=What should I do? What should I do to save it all?\nThe woes are everywhere, the disaster is everywhere.\nAlthough the world is already working hard to fight against it, our future is doomed and this is too late...\nThe Zeus Group is about to start the final construction here, and the Gate of Fate composed of three transmission platforms is about to open. \nDuring the last project acceptance, we could see a brand new world beyond the gate! \nHowever, can we solve everything by walking away...\nIn case, I mean in case, we bring disaster to the other side of the gate...\nNo, I will never let such a thing happen. What happens here stays here.\nI have to act as soon as possible, lest they find out about my plan.

324031=The exploration of the Ruins of Eden was rewarding, which would gradually reveal the veil of the hidden world. By parsing the information in Crystal Matrices, the survivors discovered three giant ring-shaped structures guarding the place. Apparently, they had been veiled in the same way, blinding the survivors to them. These rings were like giant gates that had been standing on the earth since the age of mythology, but whether they would lead humans to heaven or hell remained unknown.
324032=The world was reset again, and the survivors needed to head for Eden again. On the way, Crystal Matrices in their hands emitted a faint blue light, proving that perhaps it was not as simple as an information storage medium. This also confirmed from another angle that there must be deeper secrets hidden in those "rings", just as what we'd learned from doomsday Laboratory and the Ruins of Eden.
324033=The rings that went straight into the sky in the distance were like giant gates that had been standing on the earth since the age of mythology, but whether they would lead humans to heaven or hell remained unknown.
324034=Instead of bringing evolution as expected, experiments in the Gates of Fate unleashed terrifying demons. The researchers watched helplessly as the experimental subjects became hideous, tearing the shackles apart.
324035=Besides being a laboratory, the Gate of Fate seemed to have other functions. When the three of them were activated together, it was also the time when the Gate of Time and Space opened.

More importantly, it was home to many top-notch techs. Explore and occupy the place! It would be key to the revival of the doomed world. Meanwhile, on the other end of the dimension, a light kept blinking, signaling new visitors behind the space portal. Looks like it's not gonna be an easy battle. Time to fight for survival and our future!

331481=There are many <color=#E5131B>strongholds</color> nearby. Let's see what we can find there.
331482=We sent a distress signal just now. The rescuers are coming to us from other Dimensions. Set us free, please!
331483=It's your honor to be enslaved by our Zombie Legion, don't you understand that? Now that we have new food, you guys are of no use.
331484=Geez! Do you see what I see? A zombie is...t-talking...over there?
331485=How come zombies in this dimension start to talk?
331486=Darn it. We are fooled by the misinformation. We gotta leave the place NOW.
331487=The portal behind us is closed. The only to go back would be to <color=#E5131B>occupy Eden</color> and use the portal inside.
331488=Save those survivors encircled by zombies first before we figure out what's going on here.
331489=Telling from the relics, the city could be quite glamorous in the past.
331490=This is obviously a <color=#E5131B>key city</color>, surrounded by its <color=#E5131B> affiliated cities</color>.
331491=If we could <color=#E5131B>take back the key city</color>, we'll be able to build a camp for survivors and gain a foothold.
331492=Wait. Look at the smart zombies everywhere in the affiliated cities.
331493=To secure the key city, we need to <color=#E5131B>liberate the affiliated cities first</color>.
331494=Woo. There're so many of 'em! I guess you are right. Let's start from an affiliated city then.
331495=Stay strong, guys. As long as we work together, we'll rebuild our homestead one day.
331496=Bravo! We got the key city! Now we can <color=#E5131B>build a camp</color> here!
331497=You may <color=#E5131B>edit the name and flag for the camp</color>.
331498=Don't forget to complete the <color=#E5131B>transport missions</color> to build the camp faster.
331499=Here are the <color=#E5131B>routine missions</color>. Complete them to build the camp faster.
331500=The smart zombies might have noticed what we're up to. Get ready for any possible attacks.
331501=Ahhhh! What's that? A zombie horde! They're comin' at us!
331502=Get ready, guys. Time to meet our new enemies!
331503=Telling from the sheer size of the horde, the attack is gonna last for a while longer this time.
331504=The zombies could undermine our camp's Prosperity and slow down its growth. We gotta defend it with all we've got.
331505=When all key cities are down, the camp will <color=#E5131B>stop functioning</color>. We'll NEVER let that happen!
331506=Perhaps we could try another tactic -- attack is the best form of defense.
331507=Look! Here's a research journal. Let me see...looks like it's an experiment on an "<color=#E5131B>Optical Camo</color>".
331508=I've heard of it before! The thing that can <color=#E5131B>shield us from zombies for half an hour</color>!
331509=Its Energy will be restored to 840 pts every week. Alliance leaders and R4s can set the Optical Camo plan <color=#E5131B>each week</color> for the coming week.
331510=Try to leverage the Optical Camo to defend the camp!
331511=We've saved so many survivors! I'm so proud of our great team!
331512=This is far from enough. We need more hands to help us expand the camp.
331513=I see. Let's complete more <color=#E5131B>transport missions</color> then to enlarge the population.
331514=Okay. The more hands we have, the faster we can expand the camp.
331515=The transport mission will require us to stay vigilant.
331516=Once the smart zombies sense a trace of humans, they'll come at us all together.
331517=Commander, our camp <color=#E5131B>lost all the key cities</color> and <color=#E5131B>stops functioning</color>.
331518=The <color=#E5131B>routine activities could not be maintained</color> this way, which will surely slow down our growth.
331519=Don't be sad. Let's work together to regain our key city!

331522=[Transport Mission] Participation Rewards

331532=In the [Doomed Land] Dimension where all cities are riddled with zombies, you'll need to occupy key cities, build your camp, and fight off zombies.

331533=Following the capture of the key city, a survivor camp will be auto-constructed. When both the camp's Prosperity and population reach their max level, the camp level will increase.
331534=After building the survivor camp, you may increase its Prosperity, Population, Honor Score, and Honor Coins through transport missions, camp routine, zombie attacks, etc. On the Camp Building page, you can study relevant techs to provide bonuses to all alliance members. With Honor Coins, you can purchase various valued items in the Camp Shop.
331535=Alliance leaders and R4s can start and refresh transport missions. At the scheduled time for a transport mission, a Transport Vehicle will be dispatched from the camp's key city; the mission is deemed completed when the vehicle gets to the destination. Based on the mission difficulty, the vehicle could stop over at Fleet Posts multiple times midway.
331536=Zombies could attack the vehicle while it stops over at a place, damaging the supplies on it and affecting your revenue. If the supplies are all damaged, the mission fails.
331537=Complete missions on the camp routine page to gain Honor Score, Honor Coins, and activity points. When having enough activity points, you can claim due rewards. Missions and rewards will be reset at 0:00 daily (Game Time).
331538=There could be difficult missions sometimes, such as "Rescue refugees", which will need you to perform the missions in the world.
331539=As the camp level increases, more Camp Building content will be unlocked. Meet the Prosperity and Population requirements to study the content. All Commanders can participate in camp activities to gain speed-up items for the Camp Building.
331540=Survivor camps will go through frequent zombie attacks right after their construction and in the following weeks. Tons of zombies could launch attacks at the camp's key city and surrounding Fortresses.
331541=Zombies attacking a key city can reduce its Prosperity and Population continuously. Station your troops outside the city to make a preemptive attack. If the key city is down, the camp will stop functioning. So please defend the camp with all you can do!
331542=The camp has an Optical Camo feature. Alliance leaders and R4s may consume some Energy to set Optical Camo plans and shield themselves from zombie attacks.
331543=At the Camp Shop, you can find a vast array of precious items. The categories will increase as the camp levels up; some items are accessible only after you occupy an advanced key city.

370627=The story behind
370628=The fortress has been in the atmosphere of Christmas for a while. Unlike the places full of zombies and enemies outside, people in here seem to have forgotten the troubles of survival and are immersed in this long-lost peaceful festival. At this moment, even Natalie the cold has joined to decorate the Christmas tree, while Fernando and Emma are tussling at the dining table; it's incredible to Brady to see all of this. \n\n Survival is not the biggest issue now compared to just a few months ago when they moved into the fortress, his main concern has become when to exterminate the zombies and get back to the ground.\n\n"Hey, don't worry about it.", Natalie patting Brady's shoulder, "I've seen what you are thinking." \nN.A.T.E comes over as well, "According to the analysis, there are 178,023 fortresses celebrating Christmas today." \n\n"Look!" Fernando's voice comes from upstairs, "Look outside! The fortresses are shining like stars in the sky!" \n"Idiot," said Emma, " these stars are not as bright as ours even their lights stack up together. Our fortress is the brightest star!"
370629="Anyone want to have some candy?" Fernando shook the candy in his hand, "I just bought from the helicopter, Christmas special!" \n"What's a Christmas special? N.A.T.E doesn't understand.” \n"It's some candy that's only sold at Christmas, you claim yourself an intelligent robot and you don't even what candy is?" \n"Emma, you can't laugh at a robot! That's not cool!" Brady shook his head, they are not acting like any grown-ups. \n "Let me take a look." Natalie looked at candy in Fernando's hands, "I want to have this." \n"I didn't even know you like candy cane, that's another side of Natalie." Fernando laughed. \nNatalie held up the candy cane and posed it like a gun, "Say that again and watch out for me hitting you with a candy gun." \n\nSnap. From N.A.T.E comes the sound of a camera. "Christmas special photo."
370630="Transporting...Christmas decorations have been transported...by 50%"\n"Christmas decorations......have been collected......by 30%" \n"N.A.T.E has competed 1,326 transportation missions at a speed of 2m/s, helped 57 people. \n\n"Stop. N.A.T.E , stop." Fernando patted N.A.T.E on the head, "You are a big help today!", came Brady's voice, " Fernando, come and give me a hand on moving these crates!" \nFernando walked to the warehouse with N.A.T.E following him. "N.A.T.E , go back to charge yourself.", said Fernando, "I can't move you if you stop working halfway." \n"N.A.T.E copies", then it moved slowly to the Charging Station. \n\n As Brady and Fernando were resting in the kitchen, N.A.T.E came back in. "Intelligent robot is at your service.", N.A.T.E served them milk, "Record, Fernando and Brady are over exercised, they need to rest and have some water." \n\n N.A.T.E turned back to the Charging Station, "Record, Fernando and Brady are N.A.T.E's friends."
370631=People in the Fortress have been preparing for the Christmas as of lately. Some started to drink, some knitted Christmas scarves and some are decorating the Christmas Tree. However, Natalie acted as if she ignored all of that, still doing the same training every day, caring for her gun. It seemed that this holiday has nothing to do with her. \n\nEmma sighed, looking at the loner. \n\nNext day when Natalie woke up, she found Christmas stocking hanging over her bed, with a box of present inside. It was some necessary items for gun maintenance after she opened it. Natalie looked around, seeing Emma averting her eyes deliberately, walking to the kitchen. \n\n"Thank you.", whispered Natalie. \n\nEmma paused, "You're welcome."
370632=Christmas is here. Brady looked at the distant moonlight and wondered when the last time he'd had a Christmas. He sighed and lit a cigarette. That's when he turned his head and saw Natalie was also on the roof, polishing her pistol in the moonlight, the skill was like from a veteran who had been fighting for years. \n\nThis young lady, about the same age as my daughter, what she had been through..... Brady thought inwardly and exhaled a puff of smoke. By this time Natalie had put her gun away. Without a word, she went downstairs, brought up two beers, and handed one to Brady. \n\nThey looked at each other and clinked their glasses in silence, like two color balls of Christmas, gently collided. It wasn't easy to have a peaceful Christmas, so why reminisce about the bitterness of the past!
370633=This the first time Emma has spent Christmas after the fall of the 'castle'. A little cozier than expected, she thought, thanks to the Fortress that gave her a place in this world. It would be even better if there weren't chubby Fernando grabbing food from her. \n\n Thought to herself as she looked at Fernando who was rummaging through the kitchen for food and said, "Mr. Fernando, are you going to make a big show of cooking Christmas dinner in a place like this?" Fernando didn't realize it was a taunt and responded delightfully, "My favorite thing about Christmas is that I used to decorate Christmas tree when I was a kid!" "Was your Christmas tree knocked over by a round belly?" Emma laughed. But Fernando didn't seem offended, as he said, "It's all because Emma's so good at cooking. I couldn't spare my tummy." \n\n Emma listened and stunned. She fished out a bell from storage and handed it to Fernando, "Then you'll have to come help with the Christmas tree decorations this year."

398282=Sorry, man. We have to start from these peripheral cities to look for where the zombie virus actually comes from.
398283=Keep your eyes peeled, guys. We'll head to the central city block by block.
398284=Every step we take will take us closer to the unexplainable mystery.
398285=Exactly. As per our investigation, we'll have to go through these cities to get to the center.
398286=Every book starts with page one. We need to capture a Lv. 1 city first as our starting point.
398287=Then we'll move on to the cities riddled with zombies. Don't expect to run into a single human being there.
398288=Then, we'll see the cities with severed communications. We gotta restore the connection as fast as we can.
398289=The entire city is shrouded with the fog that comes out of nowhere. This doesn't look good.

398302=I saw several incredibly powerful ones just now.
398303=Finally we can see somethin' different from those walkers. They're invaders. Let's call 'em "city-invading zombies"!
398304=Why do you look so excited?! I'd better find a place to hide first. I'm not and will never be an adventurer.
398305=C'mon, man. You are stronger than you think. We really gotta move now.
398306=Let's try to get rid of 80% of the zombies in the city first.
398307=They are quite different from the brainless things we saw before. Watch out.
398320=The city is in complete lockdown! What do we do? I think we should hide there for the moment.
398321=Dude. We can't be hiding from zombies all the time. Think of a way to rebuild the connection.
398322=*Smirking* Everyone can see the four prominent towers. But how do we occupy 'em all? With bare hands?
398323=It's not easy to get the city completely sealed like this. Someone cut the communications for a certain reason.
398324=That's right. Stay alert. We need to occupy the Signal Tower to airdrop some supplies.
398325=Looks like we need to occupy all the four Signal Towers.
398326=We do need the supplies before we move on.
398340=*Shivering* Ahh! I hate the fog! I can't even see a zombie three yards away. Are we really gonna go ahead like this?
398341=Calm down, Fernando. We'll slow down and get to the entrance of the city step by step.
398342=*Panicked* I-I'll stay behind you. You gotta get rid of wh-whatever popping out of the fog! Promise me!
398343=The density of the fog is gettin' more abnormal. Somethin' unknown could appear at any second. Stay alert.
398344=Yep. Stay closer, everybody. Don't act alone.
398345=The scene is 100% identical to what I read from a mystery novel.
398346=But I don't wanna get lost in the god-forsaken place as the characters in that novel. I got a report to finish.
398360=*Gasping* Gosh! The Laser Tower is way taller than it looks from a distance.
398361=The tower is a weapon. Control it, and we'll have insurmountable power.
398362=Woo! Is this real? The thing is like an invention of some alien civilization.
398363=Let's see what's inside Eden first. Whatever the Laser Tower can do, it's in our hands.
398364=And the light beam in an eerie color! What the heck is that?
398365=Wait. Did you just say it's a weapon? It'll not target us, right?
398400=Invalid attack
398401=Commander, as the Signal Tower has been occupied by another alliance, your attack becomes invalid. Your troops are sent back to your Fortress. The Special Fuel consumed was returned to you as well.
398402={0} was scouted
398403=Where Does the Virus Come from
398404=We are seeking to trace the origins of the virus and the monsters, hoping to cut off the source of it all. Though the investigation is bound to be arduous, we at least have our allies who will continue the journey with us. We have no idea what awaits us up ahead.

400163=Click on the material to start production.
400164=A synthetic metal that integrates the advantages of all metals; It contains no metal elements but has the electrical conductivity of metal and is suitable for most weapons. Of course, the downside is that it's not very easy to find.
400165=It's usually transparent, highly light-transmissive/refractive, and pretty durable. Mostly used in instrument manufacturing and protective equipment, it can be made into hollow devices and one-way/two-way bulletproof glass.
400166=The type of tree employed after the outbreak; delivers high hardness and density. The equipment made from this material is often seen as promising.
400167=Compared to natural fibers, synthetic ones are materials that survivors have improved in response to current conditions and needs. It is regrettable that once ubiquitous synthetic materials have become a feature of stable productivity.
400168=Typically seen in all kinds of fractional fabric in the market, they are solid and durable. Today, piles of intact cloth are usually seen in history books.
400169=Materials commonly used in armaments and advanced industries; They were once seen only on television but now have come into ordinary people's lives.
400170=Rattans are common materials survivors scavenge and sell, of which the harder and thicker ones can fetch a good price.
400171=The components that give blacksmiths headaches. Used in most manufacturing industries, they are easy to buy and go missing.
400172=Rare commodity among other coating materials; Only a few accessories or rare gears use this kind of advanced material.
400173=Tanned and vulcanized, the hides are flexible, grease proofing, and antifouling, even with a slight stiffness. It's an excellent choice to make them into an outfit or just a lining.
400174=A daily necessity for the craftsmen and survivors' families; Most things they pick up and trade from second-hand shops are crude and rusty, making sandpapers a great solution to some problems.
400175=Reprocessed small components; As the factories that can produce small components dwindle, people started to collect small parts that can be reprocessed for use.
400176=Carbon fiber, once a good material for high-tech equipment such as aerospace, for its renewability, lightweight, and durability, is now the most common material in regular workshops.
400177=A type of steel with high strength and elasticity with high fatigue limit; Although it's less suitable for welding, it seems that high strength is more important nowadays.
400178=Rumor says it's a gem that shoots lasers, though it can't. Refracting lasers is all it can do, and it still sounds impressive.
400179=As the survivors had fewer opportunities to hunt in the wild, Gopher teeth and skulls of animals that can be reared in captivity have been taking the place of the skulls of cattle and sheep and wolf teeth.
400180=Also known as synthetic or anti-cracking fiber, a common fiber material produced from petroleum and has a strong polymerization ability. It can play a valuable role in polymerization, whether used in protective equipment or building materials.
400181=Famous for its warmth and softness, cashmere is now more valuable than lamb. In some places, "cashmere" is produced from the hair of Gophers.
400182=A new term that has only appeared in recent years; refers to the material that contains high levels of energy or the technology or process involved in making it.
400183=A high-energy chip with built-in molecular collision capabilities; can be used as a consumable power source in various equipment, but recycling will be a big problem once the power runs out.
400184=It has higher thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity than any metal accessory. Lighter and more stable with no specific metal elements, it can be widely used in underground fortresses to avoid magnetic attraction.
400185=It is usually used to make long-wearing equipment that requires high protective performance. For that purpose, lighter materials free of geomagnetism or radiation impact were used. After all, zombie attacks are not predicted, and we must always be prepared.
400186=An anti-virus or anti-oxidant coating that is often misunderstood as a high-energy coating; It's popularly cost-effective and can increase the durability of the original equipment.
400187=With high strength, good corrosion, and high heat resistance, it can adapt to various extreme environments. Although the process's performance is flawed, making it less refined and wear-resistant, it's acceptable for jewelry nowadays.
400188=A coating product that can be mixed with paint or applied independently to other materials to achieve a polished effect. It's also easily erased when you need your traces covered.
400189=A technological coating that's more than just a pure gold metal covering; It can smooth the texture of metal, which prevents the corrosion of metal weapons.
400190=A synthetic ruby, also known as red corundum; Due to the lack of gemstone mining conditions, rubies are easily industrially synthesized nowadays. It is second only to diamond in hardness.
400191=High and low-temperature resistant and can be easily attached to metal, plastic, rock, and fabric; It is mainly used for armor and weapons adhesion to replace the welding process. You can also use it to escape and take refuge.
400192=With the toughness of metal and nylon wire, it is a new material developed and produced by Alpha Company. Needless to say, it can be used to manufacture and upgrade various equipment.
400193=In areas where volcanic eruptions often happen, the lava produced by the heat flows into the brine. Solidifying rapidly, it forms a particular crystal of minerals. Among craftsmen, the chips made from such a crystal are the key reason that makes a best-selling product.

405100="Alright, folks! The induction ceremony for our fresh recruits starts now!"\nAs the military bugle blared from the platform, the latest batch of Minutemen rookies filed in. Among them stood the petite figure of Kobayakawa, drawing eyes amidst the towering recruits.\n"Huh? When did we get so desperate that we're taking in kids now?" Benson, lounging in the audience, pointed and sneered at the little girl in the crowd.\n"I wouldn't want her in my assault unit. She'd probably drop before we even reach the mission site."\n"Don't judge a book by its cover. At least, judging by the weapon she's carrying, she's no ordinary rookie." Rebecca cast an admiring glance at Kobayakawa who was confidently displaying her prowess amidst the crowd.\n"Don't underestimate the girl I rescued. Her strength has earned recognition from Commander Bolton himself," Alisa chimed in indignantly. "You better watch out not to get bested by a little girl."\n"Is that so? We'll see."\nThe opening remarks had concluded, and Bolton raised a hand to halt the squabbling among the captains, stepping forward to deliver his welcoming address: \n"The Minutemen thrive on fresh blood, and we welcome anyone with the grit to join us. Remember, the future of the Minutemen depends on each and every one of you."
405101=Alisa was the one who rescued Kobayakawa from the lab. Since the latter had no memories of her experiences before arriving there, Kobayakawa had to stay with the Minutemen temporarily, tagging along with Alisa in their daily life and missions.\nWhether it was Alisa's agile figure darting through the zombie horde to search for survivors, or Commander Bolton bravely holding his shield against the onslaught, carving a path through the undead, both left a lasting impression on Kobayakawa. Her desire to join the Minutemen and become a brave soldier like Alisa only grew stronger.\n"Join the Minutemen?" Bolton paused from polishing his shield, giving Kobayakawa's head a playful ruffle. "It's good to have that thought, but protecting the weak and defending our home is a job for grown-ups."\n"Don't underestimate me! I can handle a few zombies!"\n"Give her a chance," Alisa interjected on Kobayakawa's behalf.\n"She's helped me a lot during rescue missions, and it's clear she has some fighting skills. Besides, aren't the Minutemen always hoping for more recruits? I believe Kobayakawa can set an example."\n"Well then... Kobayakawa, can I trust you to check out the recent zombie activity reported in the northwest community?"\n"I won't let you down!" Kobayakawa replied in a determined tone, attempting a sloppy salute.
405102="Heh, you, the little squirt! You stole my mission? Got some guts, huh?" Benson stormed through the gate, confronting Kobayakawa with fury.\n"No one's ever dared to steal my missions before. You must be feeling real lucky!"\nKobayakawa, barely reaching Benson's chest in height, faced the man twice her size without a hint of fear. With hands on hips, she countered confidently,\n"My success rate in rescues is the highest on the team. Naturally, the mission was assigned to me."\n"When I was roasting zombies for barbecue, you weren't even born yet. You seem like you're just itching for a challenge. How about I let you taste the power of my flamethrower?"\n"I'd like to see you try! My Gatling gun isn't just for show."\nAs Benson's flamethrower heated up in his hand and Kobayakawa loaded her Gatling gun, the other soldiers around them abandoned any thoughts of intervening, taking cover nearby to avoid being caught in the crossfire. In the tense silence, poised on the verge of eruption, Rebecca's calm voice broke the stillness.\n"Latest intel: southeast community under attack by mutated zombies, urgent need for support. Benson, Kobayakawa, prepare to depart in half an hour."\n"You better watch out not to get burned by my flame during the fight."\n"Likewise, don't expect me to come help after I've evacuated the crowd."
405103="Today, we assess the defense capabilities of Heytex 103," Coleman announced, gesturing with the data tablet as he directed the attacker and defender to their respective positions on opposite sides of the field.\n"Ms. Fujiwara, upon my countdown, unleash your full-force attack on Heytex's control panel. Heytex, your task is to defend yourself."\n"Order received. Defense mode engaged." As the loading bar on Heytex's control panel reached completion, it retracted its shoulder turrets and assumed a defensive stance, crossing its arms in front of the control panel.\n"I won't hold back," Chihiro Fujiwara declared, readying herself for the attack. She drew her sword, its blade gleaming brilliantly in the sunlight, poised to strike with precision and force.\n"Both sides ready. 3, 2, 1—Attack!"\nAs the countdown concluded, Chihiro Fujiwara propelled herself into the air, her movement swift like a lightning bolt aimed at Heytex. With a resounding clang, her blade struck Heytex's mechanical arm, producing sparks upon impact but failing to breach its defense.\n"Ugh, that armor's tougher than I thought," Chihiro muttered as her attack failed, sheathing her sword and stepping aside to reassess her strategy.\n"Assessing unit damage... Control panel intact; right arm operational; left arm joint loose. Analyzing combat data... Initiating defense mode upgrade for the 103rd time..."
405104=Doris, who had tirelessly gathered clues from the ruins infested with zombies, never expected to encounter mutated zombies among the horde. When a boulder hurled by one of these mutants struck her, she found herself unable to move her leg, watching helplessly as the horde closed in on her.\n"Is this where it all ends?"\nEven Doris herself couldn't believe she still had a chance at survival. In her despair, the sound of blades slicing through the air reached her ears, and a mysterious masked man wielding twin blades effortlessly cut through the zombie horde.\n"Right, he had a khaki-green mask, skilled with blades, and was about... " Doris described the mysterious man's appearance after being rescued.\n"Collecting data for comparison..." Heytex 103 interrupted, already analyzing the gathered information. "Facial details uncertain. There's a 35% chance the subject matches Theodore's profile."\n"Theodore sacrificed himself in the zombie onslaught, didn't he? Could it be..." Doris trailed off, sensing something must be going on with Theodore.
405105=In the aftermath of the zombie apocalypse, many young people determined to defend their homes enlisted in military school. It was there that Dylan, Coleman, and Roger—still known as Theodore at the time—crossed paths.\nThe trio brimmed with vigor and aspirations for the future. They firmly believed that with their determination, they could wipe out the zombies and bring an end to the apocalypse.\n"As long as I can protect my family, zombies don't scare me one bit," Coleman declared during training, giving his chest a confident pat and flexing his muscles. "Check out these muscles. I've trained them specifically to take on zombies."\n"Combat isn't just about strength, though," Dylan remarked, casually swinging her legs while seated, her knife twirling effortlessly in her hand before she skillfully flung it, hitting the bullseye on the wall target.\n"Anyway, we'll fight together, for the future!" Theodore said, extending his fist. The three exchanged glances and fist-bumped, sealing the promise they made to each other.
405106="What exactly is this top-tier mission that's brought us all together?" Dylan asked, her interest piqued. She never imagined she'd be teaming up with Madam Mira, assisting Heytex 103 the Anti-War Activist on a mission.\n"The mission directive is to create chaos in the Zeus Group lab and aid members in retreat," displayed Heytex's control panel, detailing the mission.\n"We still don't know the identities of the members we're supposed to assist. That's only adding to my curiosity," Mira said, gently stroking the head of her police dog, which wagged its tail furiously. "Looks like Knight here's getting excited too. Foes or allies, Knight can sniff them out."\n"Remember, our mission is to cause chaos, not uncover identities," Dylan reminded.\n"My apologies, got carried away with my cop instincts... Let's get this mission started then!"\n"Target coordinates synced. Stay vigilant, everyone. I'll take the lead." Heytex, upon receiving the command, fired a shell to stir up commotion. Amidst the smoke, Mira and Dylan swiftly neutralized the guards who rushed in at the sound. In the chaos, a familiar figure brushed past Dylan and then vanished without a trace.\n"Wait... Was that... Theodore?!"
405107=As the zombie apocalypse escalated, the virus spread across the wasteland uncontrollably. Within months, reports surfaced of the infection reaching the northern regions, even the polar countries. In a bid to unite armed forces worldwide against the undead threat, Alisa and Doris of the Minutemen formed a special brigade and journeyed to the Northern Rose Police Academy to seek cooperation from Officer Mira.\n"Officer Mira, greetings. We're a special ops team from the Minutemen, here to discuss cooperation with the academy," Alisa said, presenting the emblem that symbolized their affiliation with the Minutemen and handing over the drafted cooperation documents.\n"I've heard of the Minutemen for quite some time. It's still difficult to believe that our once pristine northern lands have succumbed to the zombie contagion in such a short time. Despite the nation's collapse and towns being razed, our police academy remains committed to protecting the vulnerable, serving as a bastion in this apocalypse. I'm delighted to forge this partnership with the Minutemen," Mira replied, her smile warm as she signed the contract.\nAnd thus, the Winter Pact was officially sealed.
405108="Don't be too hard on yourself, little girl. The weather in our northern region isn't something just anyone can endure. There's no shame in admitting defeat; it's not worth risking frostbite over," Mira said, observing Chihiro Fujiwara's fingers turning red from the cold as she stood in the snow, attempting to dissuade her.\n"No, I can tough it out," Chihiro gritted her teeth, refusing to give in. She tightened her frozen hands around the hilt of her blade, staring at the half-person-high block of ice in front of her, searching for a spot to strike that would shatter it in one blow.\n"Just a bit of cold won't make me drop my sword."\n"You're stubborn, indeed. It's time to learn the value of cooperation," Mira said, loading her gun and aiming at the ice block. "Every enemy has different weaknesses. The ice block is tough; chopping at it won't do much damage. You've got to aim at a specific spot to strike."\nBefore she finished her sentence, Mira pulled the trigger, and Chihiro swiftly followed suit, swinging her sword at the spot where the bullet struck. This time, the sturdy ice block finally shattered.\n"You see, there are plenty of benefits to teamwork."\n"...Thank you," Chihiro, always challenging herself, learned a different lesson that day.
405109=The outcasts, shunned by humans and their communities, united as co-conspirators seeking revenge against the world. Partners? We never called each other that way.\n"Boss, got some fresh intel. Those Minutemen guys are planning to set up camp near Community A. Should we...?" Max dashed into the room, eager to share the information with Enrique and hinting at possibilities.\n"Hmm, it's time to act. Who's in?"\n"Those clueless dorks with no appreciation for metal music. Count me out," Blanche waved off, still tinkering with her guitar.\n"Can we use bombs?" Quinn eagerly brandished the bomb in her hand.\n"Hey! That'd blow us up too," Max protested.\n"Bummer."\n"Looks like it's just the two of us, then. Let's go, shake things up! Dinner's on me when we get back," Seeing Quinn leaving the room, Max fixed his gaze on Barron, who was engrossed in his meal.\n"Dinner... Alright, Barron will do his best."
405110=Enrique had high expectations for tomboy Kate ever since she joined the Vindicators. He knew that one needed to keep sharpening their skills to survive in the doomsday. Therefore, he asked Blanche, who was of a similar age as Kate, to train Kate. \nOne day, Enrique introduced Blanche to Kate, "Blanche, Kate is new to our team; I need you to help her learn more about the vision of Vindicators." \nBlanche plucked her guitar strings with a nonchalant look and nodded, "Cool. C'mon, I'll show you the best melody of Vindicators; be sure to keep up with the beat!" \nKate responded resolutely, "Okay. I'll show you what I can do."
405111=When it comes to combat, Quinn, Blanche, and Betty each have their own distinct styles, but they all agree that fighting is the ultimate form of artistic expression. They firmly believe that a proper battle should give the enemy a truly unique experience.\n"My guitar belts out epic metal tunes during a fight. There's nothing quite like dying in the midst of my improvisation," Blanche couldn't help but reach for her guitar, itching to strum a tune.\n"Battles should always involve bombs—big, explosive bombs that create the most dazzling spectacle, a true feast of art!" Quinn couldn't appreciate Blanche's raucous music. For her, there's nothing more enthralling than the breathtaking spectacle of "fireworks."\n"True art should be silent and enigmatic," Betty brushed her bangs aside. "I relish the moment when foes think victory is theirs...just before I disarm them. The look of astonishment on their faces is truly priceless."\nLooks like today is another day of the Vindicators having unified yet divided opinions on the "art of combat."
405112=On a moonlit night, a woman sneaked into an alley agily. That was Betty who was trying to steal something. She deftly evaded all guards and managed to fetch the item she wanted. \n"Bravo." A low and husky voice sounded behind her. Betty held her breath for a moment, and swiftly turned around, only to see Enrique - the new leader of the Vindicators applauding for her without making a sound. \nEnrique gazed at her with an admiring look, "Betty, I heard of your name before. You really got something. Impressive." \nBetty took a step back vigilantly, "I don't see what you mean. I'm a thief, and I guess I have nothing to do with Vindicators." \nEnrique shook his head with a smirk, "A thief? Huh, that's absolutely an understatement. You're an artist! Your talent shouldn't be hidden in such darkness. Join us, and you can have everything you want, I promise." \n"Your achievement today is all built on others' death and pain. Sorry, not a fan of it." \nHearing Betty's straightforward remark, Enrique shrugged it off and continued his persuasion slowly: "What you see is only the most superficial thing. We are actually keeping this city running by enforcing the "rules" of doomsday in our way, however peculiar it looked like though. Join us and I'm sure you'll see the truth of the doomed world." \nIn the moonlight, the two's eyes met. Betty struggled with her hesitation in her mind, but she knew at that moment that her decision would change her life thoroughly.
405113=The tomboy Kate was always pumped about the urban legends of those villain-natured heroes - Ricardo the Death Whip, Max the Maniac, and Buccaneer the Clown. She even decided to join the Vindicators one day as a way to get to know them. \nIn a gloomy underground exchange, Kate finally found their recruiting point. After she walked through a spooky corridor and pushed open a heavy iron door, a noisy and chaotic underground world unfolded before her. \n"New to here?" A low voice interrupted Kate's thoughts. She looked up and saw a man with the iconic tri-colored mask surveying her with a quite critical look. It was Ricardo! She recalled the name of the man she admired for ages. Yes, that's Ricardo the Death Whip! \n"Um, yes, I'm Kate, and I..." Kate replied in an over-excited tone. \nRicardo interrupted her, "We don't need any weaklings here, you know. If you wanna stay, show me what you got." \n"Don't cry if you lose." Max blew a teasing whistle. \n"The Clown will cheer for you! Carry on! Carry on! Ha-ha!" Buccaneer was amused by his typical dry humor. \nKnowing this was her only chance, Kate clenched her fists and stepped onto the sparring stage, "Okay, I'll show you what I can do!"
405114=Barron and Buccaneer were two peculiar beings even among the Vindicators. One put everything he saw into his mouth, and the other was a cyborg who "drank" tons of oil a day as if it were coke. Their peculiar diet brought them together. \n"Geez, that piece of meat is rotten with worms. Don't you see 'em?" Buccaneer threw a surprised glance at Baron, who was just about to swallow the entire piece of meat with a nonchalant look. \nBarron nodded in appreciation of his kind-though-not-helpful warning, "All that can be put into the mouth is food. Barron LOVES food." \nBuccaneer decided to play a trick on him; he took out a can of gasoline, "Then you must want to try this: one of the most essential industrial products, with good quality of course!" \n"Oil? Not the tool for Barron; Barron does not want a stomachache." Shaking his head, Barron intuitively covered his stomach with both arms, as if recalling the pain he went through the last time he accidentally ate a can of gasoline. \n"Ha-ha, I thought you hadn't tried this 'delicacy' before. Anyway, lemme think what else I can share with you."
405115=One night, Casino, who had just concluded a fruitful gambling night, strolled on the street and stopped by a ballroom, where he was captivated by the enchanting singing inside it. He pushed open the door and peered, across the sea of audience, at Chu, the kabuki dancing on the stage. \n"Hmm...best singer and dancer in the wasteland! Who runs this place? She's mine! How much do you want, just name it." Casino then placed all he won tonight on the table. \n"S-sorry, sir. Chu is our special guest today...ugh, sh-she does not offer any other services." The owner who knew Chu's real identity explained to Casino with sweat all over his forehead. "What do you mean by she does not offer any other services? I see, just cut the crap. Tell me how much you actually want, okay? Don't worry, I'm not here for a bargain." Casino, who had always been able to handle any trouble with money, didn't get why the owner gestured him to lower his voice. He even raised his coarse voice to shout at Chu directly, "Young lady! Just name a number. I'll pay whatever it takes to buy your life!" Disrupted by Casino's rude behavior, Chu ended her performance midway and went back to the backstage. \nCasino might be good at catching every detail on a gambling table, but obviously, he was not able to read anything out of a woman's uninterested face.
405116=Everyone would agree Casino was a legend at the gambling tables. In his legendary gambling life, however, there was one gamble that he never mentioned in public – he once staked his life simply to uncover the real identity below the mask of Buccaneer the Clown. \nBuccaneer, who always showed up out of nowhere at crucial moments with an unfathomable grin on his face, could cause a commotion just at perfect timing. His identity remained a mystery for years, which greatly triggered Casino's curiosity. \nNo one knew who won the bet that night, but people did see Buccaneer and Casino walking out of the casino side by side. Perhaps the rumor was true: that creepy mask itself was the real face of the clown.
405117=Lately, a number of tragic deaths of community managers in their homes drew widespread attention. After the preliminary investigation, the police identified a ballroom that all victims had visited before the cases. The head singer, Chu, thus became a key suspect in the investigation. \n"How many times do I have to tell you that I AM JUST A SINGER." Chu, who was interrogated by the police at backstage, answered impatiently with her legs crossed leisurely. "Just think about it, Sir, how can I manage to ensure the safety of every single visitor? I'm a singer, not a babysitter." \n"No one shall interrupt the performance. You don't wanna be "kissed" by my electric whip I guess." Ricardo waved his whip until he drove the police out the door before he lowered his voice and said to Chu, "We made too many bold moves these days. Now they notice us." \n"Let it be; they can't find any evidence anyway."\n"Chu! You got a performance tonight, right? See? I come all the way from the casino for your show! See you later!" \nChu, who was putting on her makeup in front of the mirror, was startled by Casino's loud voice from outside the door. She smashed the lipstick in her hand and tossed it towards Casino's direction, "That guy really got nothin' to do; make a little noise and invite the officers to look into that idiot."
405118=Inside a top-secret file kept in the Zeus Group's safe was a record of a secret known only to the five founding members of the Zeus Group. Although they now each had their own duties and rarely met each other, the secret made them work together to secure Zeus Group's top position in doomsday. \n"Ladies and Gentlemen, upon you walking out of this room, the secret will be completely sealed with the archives. The day you leak anything about it, the day Zeus Group will start to hunt you down, to the end of the world." Roland, who was the last one to sign his name on the file, sealed it and placed it in the safe. \n"You have my word, boss. I'll secure the secret with the rest of my life." Lunn said so while patting on his round belly. \n"I never do anything unnec." Black Cat responded. \n"Copy that." Laurel who stood behind Roland swore solemnly. \n"I will not mention a word of it." Park Ji-Mi took off her hat and nodded resolutely.
405119="This is the third time I've seen you guys within a single week." Park Ji-Mi fiddled with the medical tools nimbly while teasing her two patients, "As I remember, the Ops team doesn't have to report for duty at our medical section every day." \n"It's all because of the wrong intel. The target was prepared this time. Next time...next time I'll surely catch the target by his throat." Kelly, who rarely missed the target with one attack, was checking the wound on her thigh. "I'll have the Intel Team look into every detail of the targets to avoid any other occurrences like this." While Park Ji-Mi was sterilizing Laurel's arm with alcohol, Laurel still kept talking about her mission and used her other hand to hold the phone, instructing her subordinates on the follow-ups. Park Ji-Mi looked at the two workaholics with a sigh, "You two really need to take good care of yourself first!"
405120=One day, Roland asked Laurel and Qian Qian to his office, where they had a secret conversation, "Here's the thing. I got an important mission here, and I can only entrust it to the ones I trust the most. But the mission is quite risky, you know, so I wanna know if you..." \n"The moment you saved my life, my life is yours. I'm always at your service." Laurel made clear her attitude to Roland before he finished his sentence. \n"I'll die for Zeus Group if necessary." Qian Qian, who was raised by the orphanage sponsored by the group, followed suit. Roland nodded in satisfaction, "I knew you would be the best candidates for the mission. Good. I'll leave it to you." \n"Be warriors of the group and for the group!" The two responded in unison.
405121=A rumor was circulating in the Zeus Group - never piss off agent Suzuki Ren; those who she didn't like would soon die in an "accident." Later, the rumor even got a name - the Curse of Suzuki. \n"There's no such thing as a curse. God knows what they did in the past. Right, Luna?" \n"Meow..." Suzuki scratched the black cat's chin, not bothering to clarify the rumors among her coworkers. \n"Ah! I knew Luna would be here!" Kelly tumbled through the window into Suzuki Ren's office in a second and picked up Luna, who was still meowing softly at Suzuki. "The mission was done, thanks to your intel. Who's the target this time?" \n"In fact, I didn't plan to handle 'em; those colleagues gossiping behind my back hindered my intel gathering mission, so I have to..." Suzuki let out a fake sigh, and handed over a list of the gossipers' names. "I see." Kelly leaped out from the window with her black cat and soon disappeared in the falling night.
405122=Raised in one of the most prestigious families, Galande was still able to access some precious resources even in doomsday. His family background, coupled with the fact that he never tasted the flavor of defeat in his life, made the young and arrogant Galande believed that he already had all he needed to shape the future of the doomed world. \n"You still have a long way to go, my son." Said his father, who found Galande a mentor, Scholar David. "From today on, David will show you more about combat philosophy." \n"A scholar? Did he fight a single battle? Don't expect me to learn anythin' from his empty talks." Galande didn't take the mentor seriously at first until he went through several defeats in David's class. \n"Combat is more than aimless attacking." \nInside a mirage space projected by a tiny celestial sphere, Galande was trapped for almost an hour. "Remember, enemies won't just stay put and wait for your attack." David's voice came from the distance, "Now focus. Try to locate me and attack on me."
405123="Trust me. My drones will take care of everything, okay? I don't need any partners, much less three clumsy big fellas." Penny stood between the three with a long face, peering at her overly tall new teammates. \n"Any mission from the Zeus Group shall be performed TO THE POINT." Victoria couldn't tell that what Penny said was merely a complaint, it stepped up and stopped in front of Penny like a wall, with a knife in its hand. \n"Heh. I didn't mean I refused to do the mission. Ah, when I can stop explaining such things to the robot." Penny stood on her tiptoes with her hands on her waist as if supporting her back, trying to make herself look taller in front of Victoria. Meanwhile, things weren't going well with Galande and Macklin on the other side. \n"Why do I have to work with this droopy-eyed guy? What will happen if you take off that stupid mask?" Macklin, twirling his pistol with one hand, appeared to be dissatisfied with Galande who arrested the attention of all ladies. \n"Only those who got no ability would stand there judging others all day long," replied Galande, who never appreciated the playboy lifestyle of Macklin. It seemed this mission was bound to be tricky and challenging.
405124=Galande's mother died on a mission not long after giving birth to him. Galande was only able to piece together what her mother was like from others' descriptions: tough and independent; an excellent commander. Just when Galande thought that was all he could know about his mother, a match with Victoria gave him some unexpected clues. \n"Victoria is a war machine developed by our Group. It's loaded with a combat chip containing data from all known battles. Fight it as an opponent in training and you'll grow real fast." David held the data panel in his hand to keep track of Galande's battles with Victoria. \nVictoria was one of the few robots with a female voice. One day, it struck Galande down over and over again in a cold and merciless manner, and said to him abruptly, "Fight, fight to the bitter end." \n"Who told you these words?" Those were the last words his mother left on her commander's certificate, the words that Galande repeated many times in his mind. \n"Some said that Victoria could be so highly autonomous because of its fusion with human minds," David muttered. \n"Please tell me more about it, please!" \n"I may not have access to that much info. If you wanna know more, try to be part of the management of Zeus Group."
405125=In Zeus Group's sparring room, Penny, who operated the drones, and Victoria were preparing for a simulated drill. \n"Are you ready, big steel fella? Remember, act quick, and don't get caught by the enemy." Penny checked with Victoria for the last time through her headset, while her fingers tapped rapidly on the remote control of the drones. Soon dozens of drones were activated in turn. \n"Combat module activated; ready to fight." Victoria's voice sounded calm and resolute as usual, as she pulled out the saber in her robotic arm and assumed a fighting pose. \nThe simulated drill began. \nPenny's drones were as agile as little birds, traveling through the air at high speeds, searching for the best angle of attack. Victoria, meanwhile, was as sturdy as a fortress, using her arm to intercept the enemies. \n"Victoria, on your left!" Penny monitored the situation and warned Victoria in time through the headset. \nWithout hesitation, Victoria swung her arm and hit the enemy. \n"Bravo!" The instructor spectating outside the field exclaimed, "Flawless teamwork. You broke the damage record again!" \n"Looks like the big fella isn't as clumsy as I thought. Let's work together again next time. We can break a lot more records, right?" Penny changed her mind about Victoria that day.
405126="My dear Qian, your fighting pose has been etched in my mind ever since the last battle we fought together. The moonlight is too lovely to be wasted tonight. Would you like to join me in a moonlight dinner?" \nQian Qian received another invite from Macklin. His message seemed quite sincere, but at the thought of playboy-like behaviors, Qian only found the words hypocritical. This time, Qian, who had been "harassed" many times by him, decided to give him a lesson. She appeared at the restaurant on time, but the weapon in her hand seemed unfit for the occasion. \n"Qian, I know you'll come." Macklin, who had never failed even once in any romantic relationship, said so confidently while sucking the cigar between his fingers and handing over a bouquet with another hand. "It took me days to get some fresh flowers, you know. But it's definitely worth it if it could make you happy." \n"Enough with your tricks. You might have fooled me if I didn't see someone else's lip prints on the petals." Qian sneered and cut the bouquet into two pathetic halves. "Now you see what you'll end up into if you send me one more stupid letter."
405127="Morning, Ren, any news on the record?" Every Thursday, Isaac would knock on the door of Agent Suzuki Ren's office to ask about the latest progress. \n"You know, it's hard to preserve something as fragile and useless as a record in the apocalypse." Ren shrugged her shoulder, pulled out a piece of paper, and handed it over. "Here are the coordinates of several previously existing music halls and auditoriums, but, honestly, I don't think you can find your record among the piles of debris there." \n"I see. Thanks anyway." Even if the hope was slim, Isaac still searched the places one by one. On the way back, he ran into Lunn, who ridiculed the disillusioned Isaac, "Dude, stop looking for the record. It's not even as useful as two loaves of bread. Why don't you work with me; I can get you more than a poor record, possibly a gramophone!" \n"I'm afraid I can't live on without music, especially that piece of music..." Every night when he closed his eyes, Isaac would hum the tune his wife had played for him. He decided to find the only record his wife had left behind no matter what.
405128=One day, Isaac and scholar David were having a discussion about music. \n"Classical music survived longer than us. It witnessed history and the elapse of time. An intangible treasure indeed." Isaac said to David. "I personally prefer the improvisation and creativity of jazz; you know, each performance is unique, like picking a random star in the vast universe." While saying so, David played his favorite jazz music with his celestial body player. The melodious sound arrested the attention of Roland, who was passing by. "Hmm... The tune sounds so familiar." Roland who pushed open the door sighed lightly, "The last time I heard this tune was sometime before the zombie apocalypse. Time flew by, but the melody remains the same." \n"That's exactly the charm of music." Isaac took out his collection of records, "We can enjoy the best quality of music with this record player." \n"Alright, alright. You took out your record player again." Roland shook his head. \n"Even before the apocalypse, seldom do people spend this much on music." David could not quite understand why Isaac was so passionate about music. Isaac gently stroked the strings of his violin and replied, "I'm just completing what she left uncompleted..."
405129=In the wilderness where zombies roamed everywhere and resources were scarce, the tribes were still able to thrive thanks to the protection of the Wildlings. \nHarman, chief of the tribe, guarded the tribe with an impenetrable shield; Marlen, the sharpshooter of the tribe, fought off enemies with outstanding shooting skills; Jessie, the healer of the tribe, healed the wounds of many people; Kin Ogawa, the wandering swordsman, defended the tribe with his silent blade amid the sands. \nLoong, who was new to the tribe, heard their legends from the dwellers, but never thought those were real stories. Until one day, he was trapped in the quicksand; he somehow thought about what others told him before, "Whenever you are in need of help, call the name of Wildlings. They'll always come to your rescue." \nHe began to use all the force he had to cry out for help. Minutes later, several Wildlings members did show up to his surprise.
405130=Many children born in the early days of the apocalypse were left behind in the wilderness by their parents for various reasons before they could feel any love in the doomed world. \nThat was what happened to poor Kaya and Marlen. Even after being brought back to the tribe by the chief, they stayed with each other all the time and never talked to others in the tribe. \nOne day, Marlen, who went out hunting, got injured while trying to protect Kaya. She refused to receive the treatment from the witch doctor because she was afraid that the herbal medicine of the tribe might not be safe to use. \n"Marlen, don't be afraid. The tribe is now your home, isn't it?" Jessie calmed down Marlen who appeared overly cautious. \n"If you don't mind, you can call me Mom." Although there was no bloodline bond between Jessie and Marlen, the latter somehow dropped her guard for the first time upon hearing the gentle voice of Jessie. The skillful bandaging techniques of Jessie made Marlen had a vague idea of what "mom" meant. On that day, Marlen and Kaya finally began to take the tribe as their home and started to feel its warmth.
405131=Loong, who practiced kung-fu and came from the East, set foot on this mystic land trying to study the unique training method of the Wildlings. \nWhen he arrived at the gate of the tribe, Irma was chopping wood with a thousand-pound axe that she lifted with only one hand. She wielded it with ease as if it were as light as a feather. \n"This must be the legendary power of the Wildlings!" Loong marveled at the scene. \n"Ha-ha, this is not somethin' worth marveling at. Our chief can even throw an iron anchor like a dart." Hearing the compliment, Irma showed the young man her muscles. \n"Is this unbelievable force what keeps the Wildlings Tribe growing and thriving?" Loong was still fascinated by the power. \n"The power is only used to safeguard the people in an emergency." Harman came forward and patted on the shoulder of Loong, "The tribe's prosperity is a result of the efforts of each and every one of our members." \n"Chief, could you train me into a fighter as powerful as them?" Looking at the Harman, who was known as the strongest shield of the tribe, Loong made his earnest request. \n"It takes time for you to master these skills, young man. Why not follow me and look around in the tribe? When you know more about the place, you can better understand the force." \n"No prob. Please show me more about the tribe!"
405132=An abrupt sound of horn heralded that this was not going to be a peaceful day. The patrols of the tribe dashed in, reporting that the Zombie Queen was heading toward the tribe. \n"The Zombie Queen... Looks like we are gonna have a tough fight today," said Chief Harman. \n"Chief, we fear not the Zombie Queen. We'll join the fight to defend our tribe!" Marlen proposed to lead the warriors and join the fight, "We are not safe anywhere as long as the Zombie Queen is still around." \n"Alright. Now gather the warriors. We'll meet at the gate in two minutes!" \nHe asked the warriors to set some traps along the path the Zombie Queen would pass by, but failed to hold her back. Harman then took the lead and shielded the warriors with his anchor; not far away, Marlen aimed at the Zombie Queen's head with her crossbow, trying to distract her. \n"Darn it. The arrow is not hard enough to penetrate its head!" \n"Aim at its eyes instead!" Marlen, who was frustrated seeing her arrows fall onto the ground one after another, heard a quick reminder from a mysterious man. She then altered the angle of attack and pinned an arrow right on one eye of the Zombie Queen, who paused where it was instantly. \n"Thanks for the info! You are..."\n"Knock down the enemy first." Kin Ogawa had no time to introduce himself to Marlen. He drew his sword and joined the battle. Thanks to the sharp observation and timely reinforcement of Kin, the Zombie Queen was finally suppressed and beheaded. \n"Thanks for your help. May I know your..."\n"Kin. Kin Ogawa. No need to thank me. I'm just trying to protect the land we live on."
405133=By the time Kin Ogawa arrived at the lab which was claimed to be a place to study ores, he ran into someone else who was looking for the same place. Duncan who took the task of investigating the lab tried to stop Titan from getting into the lab through the front gate. \n"I need to save my people held inside! I won't thwart your investigation. And you'd better not get in the way!" \n"Huh, no way. The noise you make will obviously ruin my plan." Duncan would not let a stranger mess up his mission. \nThe two who failed to reach an agreement were about to have a fight. That was when a loud noise sounded from inside the lab, with the ground trembling slightly. \n"Somethin' happened!" Kin was the first to dash into the lab, followed closely by Duncan and Titan. By the time they got in, the place was already in a mess. Judging from the sleeping pods with human-shaped creatures inside and the blood-stained surgery bench, one could easily tell that someone was secretly conducting human experiments here. \n"What's goin' on? Where are the people you held here?" Titan grabbed a researcher who was trying to run away. \n"It's the experiment...no...the ores! Uh...the sub-subjects all rebelled! There! Inside there!" The researcher stuttered in fright while pointing to the door of a room, from which came the roar of an unknown creature. \n"Looks like we have the same enemy now. Put aside our fight; let's handle this thing first." Kin pointed his chin at the room, suggesting a cooperation. \n"Sure. For now." \n"Agreed."
405134=In the Wildlings Tribe, Jessie, the witch doctor, was working on an anti-poison potion. She failed many times due to the lack of a suitable herb to catalyze it. One day, she consulted Eva and Elaine, who also knew something about potions, and was inspired by their novel ideas. \n"Death is an inevitable process for every life. To make an anti-poison potion, you need to find something with extremely high toxicity tolerance." Elaine took Jessie to her herb garden and gave her some herbs that grew in the swamp. \n"These herbs are natural anti-poison ingredients. You know, a person needs to have a rest to recover from an injury, the herb can revitalize a person during the process." Eva took out the Seed of Life she had soaked in a potion, "Take the root of this herb as well. It'll trigger the best effect of the potion." \nOn her way back, Jessie pondered over their suggestions, weighing the pros and cons in her mind. Suddenly she had a bold idea. \nShe decided to blend the two herbs, mingling the forces of life and death. That's how she created a ground-breaking anti-poison potion that could slow down the spread of the toxin without harming one's body. Jessie's bold attempt also gave Eva and Elaine an inspiration. They realized that life and death perhaps were intertwined with each other in some inexplicable ways.
405135=In the doomsday, the zombie crisis haunted every corner of the world. Dwellers in the tribes lived a hard life for a long time until Buri, from the Vida Tribe, paid a visit one day with his messenger Eva and invited the major tribes to work together and unite their forces. \nBuri and Eva were the first to visit the Origna Tribe deep in the dense forest. The people there lived a self-sufficient life in an isolated world. \n"Chief, the dwellers of the Wildlings Tribe need help from your mighty warriors." \n"I see. The winds of the land tell me of the hardship you are going through. I have no reason to turn down such an earnest request." \nThe Chief of the Origna Tribe then sent his most powerful warrior, Ada, to help the Wildlings Tribe. Thanks to Ada's ability to locate targets through sound waves, they found a mysterious tribe called the Bone Tower Tribe. \n"The Wildlings are suffering for a long time. Those deceased were turned into painless monsters and are wandering around outside our tribe all day long. We know the Bone Tower Tribe knows the secret of death. Could you lend us a hand?" \n"Sure. It is our duty to handle the monsters that stained the souls of the deceased." The Bone Tower Tribe sent Elaine, who was skilled in spell casting. That was the first time the three major tribes worked together to face the crisis and challenges in the doomsday.
405136=Duncan the bounty hunter had been waiting outside the Sandy Tribe for days. His target this time was the heirloom jade pendant on Loong, who was receiving special training at the tribe. Someone had offered a bounty enough for Duncan to take a break for half a year. \n"Finally, you stepped out of the gate. If it's not to maintain good relations with the tribe, I would have sneaked in and ended your life days ago." With a cigarette in his mouth, Duncan loaded his gun and aimed it at Loong's head. \n"Watch out!" Kaya noticed Duncan's move and pulled her bow the second the bullet was shot. As a result, the bullet was hit by the arrow and was deflected. \n"Who's there?" Loong drew his nunchucks and looked in the direction the bullet came from. He spotted Duncan who was trying to run away after his failed mission. "Stay there if you got some guts!" \n"Huh. It's not over yet." Duncan soon dumped Loong based on his knowledge of the surrounding terrain, "A bounty hunter will never let his prey go. Next time, you might not be this lucky."
405137=In the Wildlings Tribe, strength was the ultimate measure of a warrior. Ada and Irma, who both fought with huge axes, were iconic representations of the tribe's strength. \n"Ada, I know how powerful your twin axes are. You know what? My thousand-pound axe is no weaker than yours. Wanna have a little sparring? What do you say?" Irma proposed the challenge as she rested the axe on her shoulder. \n"Strength is not only from the weapon we use but also from a tough mind. Sure, I'll take your challenge." Ada responded in a calm tone. \nThe two went to an open area, where members of the tribe gathered to cheer for them. Irma moved first; she slashed at Ada swiftly out of a sudden. Ada reacted quickly and crossed her axes to block the incoming blow. "Don't expect to defeat me with this little strength!" Ada shunned Irma back and chopped at her from both the left and right sides with her twin axes, forcing Irma to retreat to the edge of the field. \n"Alright, alright. I lost. Well done." Irma fell to the ground after being hit in the shoulder by the back of Ada's axe. \n"It matters not whether we win or lose. We should be proud of our strength as long as we can use it to safeguard our tribe." Ada reached out to Irma and helped her stand up. They had a fist bump and went away side by side.
405138=Resources were exceptionally precious in the Doomsday. Buri and Ada, as representatives of their respective tribes, often argued over resource distribution to get more for their own tribes. As a matter of fact, few knew that the two were close friends privately and often talked for hours over drinks in the bar. \n"Your tribe snatched the largest share of ores today, huh?" Buri filled up the cup for Ada and patted her shoulder with the other hand, "You'll never back down on the resource thing even once." \n"Sorry 'bout that. But our warriors are in urgent need of ores to have their weapons repaired. I had no choice." Ada raised her cup and drank it up, "But I don't promise I'll give in next time." \n"Ha-ha. I didn't expect to buy you with just a drink. To our health!" Buri raised his cup and took a gulp. When he put it down, he suddenly put on a serious look, "But next time, I won't let you get one more share of herbs." \n"We'll see."
405139=In order to save a child caught by a zombie, Kin Ogawa was scratched by the zombie accidentally. He saw the crimson blood coming out of his wound; the next second, he felt an overwhelming dizziness and struggled toughly to get back to his tribe. \n"Urgh...I can't...can't stop here. My sis-sister was still..."\n"Wait! Who are you? This is the territory of the Bone Tower Tribe." Elaine stopped Kin with her scythe. Before she could ask for his identity, he fainted as a result of zombie toxins. \n"Got bitten by zombies?" \n"Save him, please! He got bitten when trying to save me." The child who was still held tightly in Kin's arms, cried for help. \n"The toxin is now all over his body. We need to scratch the toxin from his bones to stop it from spreading. It's gonna be painful, and...may not be successful." Though moved by the poor child, Elaine was still unsure whether it was a wise choice to get involved in the tricky matter. \n"Just go ahead. I can stand it." Kin somehow managed to awake from the coma and grasped Elaine's arm desperately, "Please...I have...to live on...I..." Elaine finally made up her mind on seeing Kin's will to survive. "Alright. I'll do what I can do."

600061=Vanguard Diary (New World)\nThe dark rift devoured over half of the world. We had to embark on a new journey, exploring an unknown world once again. Like before, the poisonous gas and ores were still everywhere as our eyes could see. Yet, the terrain seemed to be quite different.\nWhat is the relationship between Eden, the portal, and the different worlds we were transferred to? We need to do something to settle down first. Maybe we could start with occupying some Blocks and collecting ores.
600062=Vanguard Diary (New World)\nThe environment of the new world was worse than we expected. The most daunting threat would be those Zombies who were getting even more powerful. Luckily, our researchers already completed the design of a variety of Facilities. With these Facilities, the strength of the soldiers was significantly enhanced. It's time to cleanse the Zombies again.
600063=Vanguard Diary (New World)\nTo get to the other side of the mountain range, the troops began to march toward the cities in the valley. As we explored more cities, the troops found some traces of human activities in the cities.\nThat is to say, there still were some other survivors apart from us? This info made everyone feel uneasy. Are they friends or foes? We need to figure it out.
600064=Vanguard Diary (New World)\nThe discovery of the traces of strangers made us more alert. Where did they come from? What did they want? Are there any other portals in other worlds? There are more questions than answers at the moment. The only thing we know is to occupy Eden before others do. That might be the only way to find the answer.
600065=Vanguard Diary (New World)\nWitnessing the world falling apart little by little, we operated the portal to get ready for the teleport. As was shown on the monitor of the portal, there really were other survivors who were heading to the same destination as us. This time, we come prepared and have nothing to fear. We will take the lead and see what we can do in the new world.
600066=Vanguard Diary (New World) -- Day 2\nWe began our exploration of the new world with great caution. Soon, we noticed the abandoned Doomsday Laboratory. To our surprise, there were many extremely advanced precision instruments and apparatus. Who left this Facility here? With all these doubts on our minds, we decided to cleanse the Zombies in the lab first.
600067=Vanguard Diary (New World) -- Day 3\nThrough the control panel in the lab, we found that the lab was closely related to the cities in the world. From the lab, we could remotely activate the defense system in those cities to improve their attributes.\nThis will no doubt boost our power and help us conquer Eden. For this reason, it's quite important to be the first to occupy the Doomsday Laboratory.
600068=Vanguard Diary (New World) -- Day 4\nWith the help of the Doomsday Laboratory, the troops broke into the inner ring and moved toward Eden. Around Eden, the troops found many meandering rivers and streams, looking like cracks in the earth. This scene reminded us of the dreadful moment when the old world was about to be devoured by that great rift.\nThe ground of the new world looked increasingly similar to the world eroded by the dark rift. Will Eden put an end to this recurring cycle this time?
600069=Seek help
600070=Please choose a Faction to look for Heroes\nIn each Hero seeking, the Heroes you already found will NOT appear in the seeking.
600071=Vanguard Diary (New World) — Day 1\n[Is it an ominous warning or a new challenge? Seemingly innocuous smoke constantly escaped from the portal, preventing us from meeting our allies. The red light vaguely flashed in the fog, hastening us to locate their position. No time to waste. We must act now!]
600072=Vanguard Diary (New World) — Day 2\n[The fog helped hide our position, but it also concealed the tracks of our enemies. As we traveled through the fog, we also discovered enemies more powerful than before... Pondering what awaited us, we saw a whitish glow vaguely glimmering ahead, beckoning us...]
600073=Vanguard Diary (New World) — Day 3\n[Approaching the light, we discovered ruins we could not apprehend. A system of life independent of the outside world exists, along with futuristic mechanical guards and buildings that are breathtakingly grand. As more ruins were discovered, we wondered whether there were secrets or treasures hidden in such a complex. Whatever there be, we must have it!]
600074=Vanguard Diary (New World) — Day 4\n[With our invincible army, we have conquered more and more ruins. The soldiers are ready, and it's time we marched towards Eden! What kind of connection do these mysterious ruins have with Eden, though?]
600075=Clue
600076=Vanguard Diary (New World), Day One: \n[We have come to the new world, and everything is going well! The question is, what do those huge and mysterious buildings in the distance represent? ]
600077=Vanguard Diary (New World), Day Two: \n[We are approaching those buildings. They look like... unusual doors? And there is a mysterious envelope left in every building, which we dare not open rashly, so we only left it in place, hoping when our troops arrive, the truth it represents can be revealed!]
600078=Vanguard Diary (New World), Day Three: \n[After the trials in several worlds, we are obviously stronger and more united than before. Because the command system is more mature now, we formed a more powerful legion!]
600079=Vanguard Diary (New World), Day Four: \n[As we occupy more cities, the three huge and mysterious buildings gradually emit a strange light. We'll keep marching to Eden without letup! But what kind of connection do those buildings have with Eden?]
600080=Vanguard Diary (New World), Day 1\nWe made it! Here we are in the new world! This is a divine realm floating in the sky among a sea of clouds!
600081=Vanguard Diary (New World), Day 2\nThe place is not polluted! Listen! The place is not polluted!!
600082=Vanguard Diary (New World), Day 3\nDarn it! The resources here are barely enough for a small group of survivors. This is only a place to survive, not to thrive.
600083=Vanguard Diary (New World), Day 4\nWe found a device that could help us go between different space-time. With this device, we can travel freely to any place, which means resource scarcity will no longer bother us!

610069=Strongest Alliance Rules:\nStrongest Alliance is a four-week competition in which each alliance fight against the other to get rewards.\nAfter entering S1, the alliances that meet the conditions will automatically join the competition when the event begins.\nStrongest Alliance has four tiers: Silver, Gold, Diamond and Master. The first-time alliance will start from Silver and compete with other alliances of the same tier.\nWithin the near zones, the alliances of the same tier will be divided into several groups. There are 12~23 alliances in each group.\nThe alliances in the same group are randomly matched in Alliance Duel and gain tier points (TP) according to the daily results.\nResources Collection Duel on Monday: The winner gets 100 TP, while the lost alliance gets 30 TP.\nFortress Building Duel on Tuesday: The winner gets 200 TP, while the lost alliance gets 50 TP.\nTechnology Research Duel on Wednesday: The winner gets 200 TP, while the lost alliance gets 50 TP.\nHero Growing Duel on Thursday: The winner gets 200 TP, while the lost alliance gets 50 TP.\nSoldiers Training Duel on Friday: The winner gets 200 TP, while the lost alliance gets 50 TP.\nEnemy Defeating Duel on Saturday: The winner gets 500 TP, while the lost alliance gets 100 TP.\nThe All-Out War event opens every Tuesday, where the alliance can fight against any other alliance in the same group. Successfully declaring war and winning gets 20% of the opponent's TP.\nAt the end of Strongest Alliance, the alliance tier will be promoted or demoted according to the TP ranking in the group. The higher the tier is, the better reward the alliance gets.\nAfter the event ends, the new tier will take effect in the next Strongest Alliance.
610070=All-Out War Rules:\nThe All-Out War event starts during the Strongest Alliance. Alliances in the same group can choose any other alliance to declare war. Successfully declaring war and winning gets 20% of the opponent's tier points.\nThe event is divided into three stages: Peace Day, War Declaration Day, and Warring Day.\nPeace Day: Members above R4 (R4 included) can choose to set a truce period. During the truce, you won't be declared war by other alliances nor enter any war.\nWar Declaration Day: Members above R4 (R4 included) can declare wars against any other alliance that is not in the truce in the same group. After a successful war declaration, both alliances will receive a system email and enter the war preparation stage, waiting for the war to start.\nWarring Day: According to the result of War Declaration Day, the alliances that have entered the war preparation stage will enter the war at the corresponding time. The war lasts 4 hours, during which killing/wounding the enemy soldiers, destroying the enemy facilities, and attacking the enemy city till it's fallen can grant you points. At the war's end, the alliance with higher points will be the winner. If the two sides in a battle are from the same Dimension, attacking each other in this Dimension will also grant them points.

610087=War Rules:\n1. The war lasts 4 hours. When the war begins, the system will randomly select a city in the territory of both sides as the spawn point. Commanders can relocate the fortresses to the spawn city. If the opponent has no cities, the attacker can move to any map location.\n2. The attacker can go back to near the Main Alliance City directly through the event page.\n3. The attacker can only (temporarily) occupy the opponent's spawn city before any other city. After the city is occupied, it will enter a protection state and temporarily belong to the attacker.\n4. After the war starts, both alliances can not change the Main City or give up any city.\n5. After the war ends, all invading commanders can directly return to near their Main Alliance City. All invading commanders will automatically return to their Zones at the end of Warring Day.\n6. If the opponent does not have enough cities or Main Alliance City, the attacker can get the corresponding bonus and points directly.\n7. If the alliances are in the same Zone, the cities in the protection state will be returned at the end of the event.\n8. During the war, Eden can only be attacked by the adjacent alliance, not the opponent in Alliance Duel. The battle rules for Eden remain unchanged.\n9. During the war, you can get points by killing/grievously wounding the enemy soldiers, destroying the enemy facilities, and occupying the enemy cities:\nKilling/wounding a Lv. 1 soldier gets 1 point.\nKilling/wounding a Lv. 2 soldier gets 2 points.\nKilling/wounding a Lv. 3 soldier gets 3 points.\nKilling/wounding a Lv. 4 soldier gets 5 points.\nKilling/wounding a Lv. 5 soldier gets 7 points.\nKilling/wounding a Lv. 6 soldier gets 10 points.\nKilling/wounding a Lv. 7 soldier gets 15 points.\nKilling/wounding a Lv. 8 soldier gets 20 points.\nKilling/wounding a Lv. 9 soldier gets 30 points.\nKilling/wounding a Lv. 10 soldier gets 40 points.\nDecreasing the enemy's Facility Durability by 1 point gets 3 points.\nOccupying the enemy's main city gets 50,000,000 points.\n10. If the two sides have the same points, the side that declares the war wins.

641010=Capturing a City
641011=Outpost
641012=Season Rewards
641013=Capture a Lv. 1 city to get started in the new season.
641014=In the new season, Commanders may capture Blocks freely.\nCapturing a Block requires it to be connected to one of your own/your allies' or a city of your Alliance.
641015=Red and Blue Mines are seasonal resource points where Red and Blue Ores are produced continuously upon occupation.
641016=Blocks, Red and Blue Mines are contaminated with poisonous gas and will significantly reduce your damage effectiveness when you have insufficient Immunity.
641017=Build a Clinic to help with the contamination and gain more Immunity.\nBuild a Hub to increase the number of Blocks you can have and ensure smooth resource distribution.
641018=Capturing a city, provided it's not the first capture, requires it to be connected to a Block of your own and a city of your Alliance.
641019=After capturing an Outpost, you can directly occupy the Blocks around it and gain buffs.
641020=After the season, Alliance rewards will be sent to the Alliance Leader, who will then distribute the rewards to their Alliance members.
641021=I don't like it here. This land defies every fiber of my being! How are we supposed to survive in a world like this?
641022=Calm yourself. We must first capture a level one city before taking one step after another toward Eden.
641023=Natalie! Little help here! I can't move to the next city! It's not because I'm heavy, is it?
641024=Many attempts led us to believe we can capture blocks to purify poisonous gas and remove contamination in the world!
641025=We can connect the blocks between allies to keep supplies flowing and form our way toward Eden!
641026=Look, what are those red and blue mines?
641027=Substance analysis shows something exclusive in this world. We can capture them to produce red and blue ores constantly!
641028=What?! How is my attack getting so weak?
641029=The closer we get to Eden, the more contaminated the blocks are. We'll need higher immunity to proceed!
641030=What's worse, the higher the level of red or blue mines, the more toxic they are!
641031=So what do we do?!
641032=Relax. Brady and the others are working on it. It won't take long!
641033=We found something! We can use these red and blue ores to build clinics and hubs!
641034=That's great! What are clinics and hubs for, though?
641035=Clinics can provide higher immunity for the team to fight at full strength before we reach Eden!
641036=Hubs will allow us to capture more blocks and ensure smooth resource distribution. We can get even more resources!
641037=Then everything is set! Let's go conquer other cities!
641038=Hold your horses. We must first pave the way to the next city!
641039=And we can only capture ones connected to our cities!
641040=Look, Natalie! New buildings! There are so many of them on the outskirt!
641041=Those are Outposts. According to our study, we can occupy the blocks around it if we can capture one.
641042=They are very important and can grant buffs upon capture, giving us advantages when attacking or in danger!
641043=After the season, an Alliance will be rewarded according to the highest-level cities it captures.
641044=After the event ends, rewards will be sent to the Alliance Leader, who will then allocate them to the Alliance members. The Alliance Leader will automatically receive the first-tier reward.

700004=安静！你这胖子，都这时候了能不能不要开那些恶趣味的恐怖玩笑……
700005=我用我天才工程师的灵魂保证，刚刚绝对有脚步声从深处传来……
700006=别闹了吧，不好笑，而且我似乎真的开始听到一些声音了……
700007=大家冷静，我们不能掉以轻心，我也听到了，大概是…这栋建筑里丧尸走动带来的脚步声。
700008=Ehm... Don't worry about the light. An excellent circuit engineer can take care of it in no time!
700009=Who are you? And why are you here?
700010=Guess that explains the footsteps.
700011=So this is how you treat the person who just saved you?
700012=Don't get me wrong. We just wanted to know who you are. After all, you can't be too careful in a post-apocalyptic world.
700013=...Chihiro Fujiwara. I'd be long gone had I not lost track of my brother in a zombie mess.
700014=I'm not here to make friends. You're welcome to stay here if you don't trust me.
700015=...Let's just play along. It's not like we can stay here for the night.
700016=This is...an ID card.
700017=Is that...a trap door? I wonder where it leads.
700018=That's the Fortress entrance. Let's hope the facilities underground still work...
700019=Ehm... She seems familiar with this place.
700020=That's good. She can be our guide.
700021=What's that?
700022=A notebook... There might be something in it that can help me find my brother.
700023=That'd be good, but I hope we can find something useful about the Fortress.
700024=Forget about the notebook. I just wanna take a nap!
700025=Alright. Guess we all had a rough day... Let's get some rest for now.
700026=You guys go ahead. I'm gonna flip through the notebook.
700027=Hey, has anyone seen Chihiro?
700028=Her diary is just lying open on the desk. She must have found something in that notebook and took a leave hastily.
700029=I was just gone for a few days. Guess it's up to me to save the day again.
700030=Ahem... It's just a little hiccup... How's things with you? Found your brother yet?
700031=I was trying to reach the Control Center through a hidden tunnel, but things didn't go as planned. The tunnel collapsed.
700032=Hope the device still works... Based on what my brother taught me... If I remember correctly... There you go...
700033=Then...enter the command...access the Fortress's security cameras... Searching for clues about my brother...
700034=You really know what you're doing.
700035=It's hard not to when you spend your entire childhood in this place...
700036=*Radio static* ...Why are you doing this?! ...You... You'll destroy the whole Fortress!
700037=It's my brother!
700038=I'm sorry, Mr. Kin Ogawa. I have my reason... Since the cat is out of the bag, I'm afraid you have to come with us.
700039=You... You'll get what's coming to you. Aah...
700040=Watchers... Sorry guys, I gotta go. We'll meet again if fate permits!
700041=Watchers? Aren't they the human's biggest hope of finding a cure? How could they...
700042=Enough, that's not our problem. Let's focus here.
700043=I hate to admit you're right, but sometimes, you just seem cold-blooded when you play cool.
700044=I'll take it as a compliment. This is how you survive in a post-apocalyptic world.
700045=Bingo!
700046=A recording named after our countersign! He was here! What happened, though? He didn't even say goodbye.
700047=A <color=#ae6e55>Work Station</color> was unlocked on the upper right side of the Control Center.
700048=启动了雷达代表我们已经向外界公布了自己的坐标。
700049=可是单凭你和我，想要守护避难所恐怕很难。
700050=别担心，我们可以在大世界上寻找更多合作伙伴。我已经联系了我的老朋友。
700051=发现雷达信号！
700052=…喂！有人能收到吗？我是义勇军藤原千寻，我发现了幸存者信号！请求援助！
700053=雷达探测到了目标位置。
700054=通过卫星地图，我们能观测到地面世界的一举一动，从而锁定目标位置。
700055=太好了，来看看她在什么地方吧！
700056=哇哦，我看到我们的避难所了。
700057=目标也锁定了，准备出发吧。
700058=千寻！欢迎你回到避难所，哈哈，你还好吗？
700059=没时间寒暄了，我找到了我哥哥小川剑的坐标，他现在的处境很危险！
700060=各位，可以陪我走一趟吗？位置已经同步到你们的雷达上了。
700061=雷达位置已锁定。
700062=唔……只凭我们真的没问题吗？他们似乎有很多<color=#ae6e55>士兵</color>。
700063=不用担心，我刚从义勇军接受救援任务时，可是听到不少有关娜塔莉、前、辈的故事。
700064=她曾经可是义勇军首屈一指的神秘特工，就是不知道为什么离开了义勇军。
700065=……这跟我们的救援无关。既然确定了方位，就赶紧行动。
700066=哥哥！是我啊！千寻！
700067=千寻…咳咳…对不起，哥哥没能遵守约定，在避难所和你汇合。
700068=才不是！是千寻太弱了！
700069=我们现在的实力还无法跟他们对抗，冒然行事只会暴露我们自己。
700070=……我想，我知道一些讯息。
700071=这是当年我在守望集团任职时所看管实验室的坐标。
700072=没想到你居然在守望集团任职过，难怪之前在中控室听到录音后你那么安静。
700073=这都是过去的事了。
700074=算了，不说这些。还是先去实验室一探究竟吧。
700075=重逢的兄妹
700076=神秘的过往
700077=交织的线索
700078=谁是黛安娜
700080=好在千寻如愿找到了她的哥哥，不过处境危险，我们要小心一点。
700081=随着调查深入，我们发现了越来越多跟当前各组织相关的过往，末日当头，乱世我们将如何自处……
700082=原来各位到避难所来都有各自的目的，避难所究竟有着怎样的曾经？只有抽丝剥茧才能接近真相
700083=费尔南德前几天捡到一个微型通讯器后就魂不守舍，这位黛安娜到底是什么来历，我们得好好调查一下了。
700085=千寻的回归
700086=收到了藤原千寻的信号，原来她是义勇军的人！不过，看起来她好像需要我们帮助！
700087=Recording A
700088=Recording B
700089=？？？
700090=I'll look around for her. And you guys...
700091=If only I knew you guys had cleared a way to the Control Center. Gotta say, good work.
700092=Rest assured. We Watchers always take care of our friends.
700093=We must first repair the <color=#ae6e55>Control Center</color> before unlocking more facilities to survive in this world...
700100=Radar signal detected!
700101=…Hey! Is anyone there? I am Rebecca of the Minutemen. I picked up signals from other survivors. Requesting help!
700102=It's Rebecca! She's an old friend.
700103=The radar has picked up the target's location.
700104=Everybody. This is Rebecca. We go way back.
700105=A deadeye sniper of the Minutemen like her can drop any enemy she scopes.
700106=Rebecca, I'd like you to meet my Fortress comrades. Brady, Emma, and Fernando.
700107=Great to meet you all! I'd love to get to know you guys when we have the time.
700108=It's been a long time. I see you still got the skills!
700109=You're not so bad yourself.
700110=I'm glad to see you've made new friends.
700111=Things might turn out differently if I had been there when you left the Minutemen...
700112=Enough about that. Look at the Fortress we built.
700113=Instead of dwelling on the past, I want to improve the future.
700114=Then at least let me help you this time!
700115=Great! With these drawings, we can improve the Fortress even further! Way to go!
700116=But, Rebecca, this is the Minutemen's intel. Are you sure you want me to have it?
700117=It's okay. You deserve it since you helped me rescue the survivors. Besides, we're all on their side!
700118=I can't believe Natalie was one of the Minutemen! She's full of surprises!
700119=No wonder Natalie got this sense of discretion on her. That deadly composure when it comes to killing zombies.
700120=Why did you leave, though, Natalie?
700121=It's a long story...
700122=She didn't tell you? Natalie was the best female agent of the Minutemen! Also...
700123=Maybe another time. Let's see if there are any distress calls from other survivors!
700124=Intel from the Minutemen suggests an urgent distress signal nearby.
700125=It's from some geologist in desperate need of our help!
700126=The target is located in a hazardous area. We can't handle this by ourselves.
700127=Crap, they got away!
700128=Molotov from the Vindicators... There's their signature!
700129=No doubt the Vindicators have our geologist. They're notorious for their crookedness. We must find them fast.
700130=Who is this geologist, anyway? He's sure getting all the attention from both parties.
700131=I've sent a request to the Minutemen. They'll give us more information.
700132=According to the intel, the victim's name is Diana. Her father is a famous architect.
700133=Diana is an outstanding specialist in her own work despite her father's fame.
700134=An outstanding geologist? We need such an expert while the Fortress construction is in full swing!
700135=You're right. We must do all we can to bring her back safely.
700136=Ready? We must not waste any time!
700137=You're safe, Diana. Now that we got you out, the Fortress will protect you.
700138=Thank god! I couldn't take it anymore... Those Vindicators... They're a bunch of lunatics!
700139=Anyway, you have my eternal gratitude! I'll do whatever I can to repay your kindness!
700140=It's okay, Diana. People at the Fortress are all nice and friendly. No more Vindicators.
700141=About the Vindicators... Natalie, how's your investigation going?
700142=You mean the truth behind me being framed as a traitor?
700143=Someone set you up and said you were a traitor using a photo of you and the Vindicators, right?
700144=Holy moly! That happened to you, Natalie?!
700145=Yes, that's why I came to the Fortress, to find proof to clear my name.
700147=Old Friend
700148=The Once Minuteman
700149=Full of Surprises
700150=Distress Signal
700151=The Geologist
700152=The radar is repaired, which means our coordinates are also in the open. We must stay alert for more threats coming our way.
700153=Rebecca, an old friend of Natalie, brought help from the Minutemen. Our success in rescuing the victim is further guaranteed.
700154=So Natalie was once a Minuteman. No wonder she is highly skilled. Things just get more and more interesting.
700155=We picked up an urgent distress call. An emergency like this requires all the help we can get!
700156=A mysterious geologist sent a distress signal in a desperate situation. We must rescue the victim from the Vindicators fast!
700157=She found the survivor. We should trace the location through her signal.
700158=Remember that building I was trapped in when I was investigating the survivors' gathering place?
700159=Using the Fortress radar, I picked up a distress signal not far from there. I must go rescue the survivors first.
700160=Let's not waste any time, then. We can catch up later after the rescue!
700161=I know a military base abandoned by the Minutemen, where we can find drawings to build a <color=#ae6e55>Soldier Training Camp</color>.
700162=I've uploaded the coordinates to the radar.

701000=*Breathing heavily* ...Here... Here should be safe.
701001=Take a breath! We're safe now!
701002=...
701003=S...sorry...
701004=Quiet! Emma, why are you covering your arm like that? Did you get bitten?
701005=Wait! You gonna shoot her?!
701006=That's the way it is to survive! Step aside!
701007=Everyone, just calm down! Let me check the wound first.
701008=What a relief. Her temperature's normal...no enlarged pupils...she's not infected. It was just a normal scratch.
701009=I know.
701010=Still, we can't let our guard down... Let's brighten this place so that we can see things more clearly.
701011=On it! An excellent circuit engineer will fix it in no time!
701013=没想到实验室已被丧尸攻陷了，看来当年的丑闻并未让守望集团放弃研究。
701014=看看这些破碎的生物罐和畸形的怪物，看来守望集团的“杰作”还不少。
701015=额……那是刚刚攻击我们的丧尸吗，天哪，它为什么会有四只手臂，好恶心。等等……
701016=瞧它手臂上的眼睛纹身，单眼、紫色、重瞳，天呐，它之前的身份是……
701017=荒野之子的祭祀！
701018=等等，你怎么会知道我们部落的图腾信息。
701019=我曾是名周转于荒野之子各部落的记者。
701020=记者……我好像听巫医提起过。
701021=因为我看到避难所研究出丧尸血清的新闻，过于兴奋连夜前往这里。
701022=丧尸疫苗的新闻？哦！我也是看到那个报道过来的。
701023=不过看避难所早已荒废的情况，所谓的丧尸疫苗恐怕只是避难所吸引幸存者的噱头罢了。
701024=不，那并不是骗人的假信息。
701025=难道……
701026=避难所在博士的带领下确实研究出一款血清，成功治愈了刚被丧尸感染的患者。
701027=但不幸的是消息遭人泄露，为抢夺丧尸血清各大势力对避难所发起围攻，避难所很快就被攻破了……
701028=怀璧其罪，更何况现在还是末日。
701029=你还有那位博士的线索吗？
701030=从守望集团逃出后我也一直在寻找博士的线索。我知道避难所另一个的逃生出口的坐标，或许那有线索。
701031=那还等什么，赶紧出发吧。
701032=唔……我还是第一次见娜塔莉那么积极。
701033=该死，这里根本什么都没有。
701034=还是头回见到你失去方寸，那位避难所的博士是你什么重要的人吗？
701035=确实是很重要的……人。
701036=之前有提到过我从义勇军离开的事情。原因是我被人诬陷是来自复仇者的间谍……
701037=他们的证据是一张我跟复仇者前首领的合照，但我清楚，合照上应该还有其他的人。
701038=你是说合照上也有博士吗？但在我所知道的情报里，博士从未离开避难所。
701039=没错，所以我才会返回避难所，想要寻找那张照片的真实版本。
701040=费尔南德，你一直鬼鬼祟祟的在那边干什么呢？话也不说一句。
701041=没，没什么……啊，别抢，那是我捡到的通讯器。
701042=布雷迪，你有没有发现费尔南德最近好奇怪。饭也不吃了，成天躲在房间里研究他捡到的通讯器。
701043=看来，里面一定还有什么我不知道的，或许你可以去问问。
701044=我才不要呢，谁管他！他不吃，还省了我做饭的功夫呢！
701045=布雷迪，布雷迪！谢天谢地，我终于破解通讯器里的坐标了，我们快去找黛安娜吧！
701046=什么坐标，还有……黛安娜又是谁？
701047=额……我的一位……朋友。
701048=哦~朋、友啊。
701049=复仇者的方巾……还有标志性的喷漆。
701050=刚才他们绑走的是谁？
701051=我们还是来晚了……我真是……我该死！
701052=费尔南德？你怎么？哭了……
701053=他们绑走的是我的一个故人，她叫黛安娜。她的父亲是位知名的建造家.
701054=她……当年因为我愚蠢的英雄主义而分手。
701055=震惊，费尔南德居然有前女友。
701056=爱玛！不是说这些的时候。
701057=你们是怎么联系的？
701058=用之前捡到的小型通讯器……不过，这通讯器的芯片不见了，似乎是被黛安娜拿走了？
701059=娜塔莉！快！试试看能不能锁定黛安娜的位置！
701061=是她！不知道她是否已经如愿找到了她的哥哥…马上锁定位置，准备出发！
701062=太好了，我们快点去找千寻！来看看她在什么地方吧！
701063=当务之急，是收集有关他们作恶的证据。
701064=当初守望集团爆出人体实验的丑闻后，我跟很多同事都选择离开。原以为集团会做出改变，现在看来……
701065=在研究部落的社会关系和语言体系过程中，跟这些神秘的族民结下深厚友谊。
701066=当年听她提起过，她跟父亲被请去设计一个军用科研地下基地，之后就再没听过他们的消息。
701067=她再次联系我，约我到避难所见面，一定是有重要的事情。
701068=可我……却没能救她……
701069=没想到半路遇到尸潮。
701070=你一直在研究巫医药粉抑制丧尸病毒的可能性。
701071=有天却不告而别。
701072=是录音里自称守望集团的家伙伤害的你吗，我一定要让他们付出代价！
701073=目前当务之急是赶紧增强我们的实力！
710000=Distress signal detected!
710001=…Hey! Is anyone there? I am Chihiro of the Minutemen. I picked up signals from other survivors. Requesting help!
710002=It's her! I wonder if she has found her brother... Locate the position. We're moving now!
710003=The radar has detected the location of the target.
710004=We can monitor everything on the ground through satellite maps, thereby locking the target location.
710005=That's great! Time to get Chihiro! Let's see where she is.
710006=Wow, I can see the Fortress!
710007=Destination locked! Let's go.
710008=Time to do some exercise after hiding underground for this long!
710009=Chihiro! Welcome back! How are you doing?
710010=No time for small talk. I've found the coordinates of my brother. He seems to be in great danger!
710011=Guys, can you accompany me on a trip? The position has been synchronized to your radar.
710012=He's not here?! Why! There must be something we missed!
710013=Don't worry, Chihiro. I'm sure your brother is okay. Natalie is good at tracking. She'll help you find him.
710014=...I checked the gunshot wounds. They were here half an hour ago.
710015=In other words, the attackers have not gone far. We can still chase them down! Let's...
710016=Why should I believe you?! The last time I checked with the other Minutemen, they said something about you being a traitor!
710017=What? Natalie was one of the Minutemen?
710018=Traitor...?
710019=She left because we got intel showing she's a spy from Vindicators! Give me one reason why I should trust her!
710020=That "intel" was just another conspiracy. We still got a chance to find your brother now. Follow me if you will.
710021=...I swear to God if you try something funny...
710022=So here we are, where Chihiro's brother should be, according to the coordinates.
710023=Are you sure? Don't even try to fool me.
710024=I believe Natalie.
710025=So do I. She had no reason to trick you. I don't think you two ever crossed paths, right?
710026=But she... Never mind. Sorry about that. Let's move!
710027=It's me! Chihiro!
710028=Chihiro! I'm sorry I couldn't make it to the Fortress!
710029=It was my fault! I was too weak and late.
710030=It's okay now. We're here. Though, I won't be staying.
710031=No! Don't go! Where are you going?! Please don't leave me!
710032=Be not worried. I'm one of the Wildlings now, and I've found my calling!
710033=I'll be back for you once I solve the conflict between the Wildlings and the Watchers.
710034=But I...! Please take care of yourself... I'll be waiting for you in the Fortress!
710035=We've spotted a place where survivors gathered. They are in danger and need our help.
710036=Come join us, Chihiro. We can use someone capable, like you.
710037=But...aren't you mad at me for what I said earlier?
710038=Water under the bridge. What matters now is, do you still think I'm a traitor?
710039=Of course not! I'm sorry...
710040=Glad to hear that. Now let's save those survivors and build an even stronger team! Let's go!
710041=Natalie, you're so kind. I wouldn't have guessed it, for I saw that "picture" of yours. There must be some kinda mistake.
710042=You mean the one of me and the leader of the Vindicators? That's the evidence they used to frame me.
710043=And it's why I came to the Fortress, to find proof to clear my name.
710044=I believe you, Natalie! So do many other Minutemen. Don't worry. I'll help you find the proof you need!
710045=Just received a new mission from Minutemen. I could use some help, guys!
710046=If it's the mission from Minutemen, then count me in.
710047=Here are the coordinates. Someone has been kidnapped, according to the intel.
710048=We got our target. Let's move!
710049=Crap, they got away!
710050=A kerchief of one of the Vindicators... Guess they're the ones behind the abduction!
710051=Who did they abduct, though, with all this effort? Some kind of bigwig?
710052=Diana is the name that's been on the news lately. Apparently, she is a well-known geologist and a pretty one.
710053=That's right. Her father was a prominent architect who left her with a "mysterious legacy" when he passed away.
710054=So the Vindicators want to get the inheritance by abducting her, right?
710055=Let's wait for more info from Minutemen. We also need to prepare ourselves in the meantime.
710056=Welcome Back
710057=Reunion
710058=Foe or Ally
710059=Reconcile
710060=Rescue the Scholar
710061=We received signals from Chihiro Fujiwara. She's one of the Minutemen! It looks like she needs our help!
710062=We've received the coordinates from Chihiro's brother. Will Chihiro be reunited with her brother?
710063=According to Chihiro, Natalie was a spy among the Minutemen... Let's not jump to conclusions just yet.
710064=Reunited with her brother, Chihiro believed Natalie was not a spy. But will they be reconciled?
710065=Minutemen issued an imminent rescue mission about a well-known geologist Diana being kidnapped!
710066=According to Minutemen, a "well-known geologist" Diana was kidnapped.
710067=Fernando, have you seen Natalie? I can't find her anywhere.
710068=I think I saw her yesterday. She said she was going to the Subway to look for something.
710069=Yesterday, you said? So she hasn't come back yet? I hope she's alright.
710070=You don't suppose she is in danger or something, right? Should we go to the <color=#ae6e55>Subway</color> and find her?
710071=I'm opening the door. Stay sharp.
710072=Hell, this place rubs me up the wrong way...
710073=There's a ladder down there!
710074=Okay, here's the plan, you go get some men, and we go down together.
710075=So you're saying Natalie was looking for something at the Subway and hasn't returned yet? That doesn't sound like her.
710076=It might have something to do with the note she found near the entrance. Dr. Gallo's signature was on it.
710077=I thought about talking her out of it till at least we could all go together, but she seemed so excited.
710078=Well, that's new. This Dr. Gallo, is he that famous scientist?
710079=According to the news, he founded the Light Station to "bring humanity hope" a few years back. This must be the place!
710080=I had no idea he was also Natalie's foster father!
710081=Light Station to bring humanity hope...?
710082=I don't care about some light station. Why are we still in this goddamn lift?!
710083=Looks like we're in the Subway now. Everyone, stay alert.
710084=This place looks creepy... Are you sure this is the Light Station?
710085=It's been abandoned for years. Anything "light" had already been turned off.
710086=What could be so important for Natalie to take this much risk... Crap, zombies!
710087=That door might be for keeping something away. Was it to separate the Subway from the Fortress?
710088=The zombies here haven't mutated, it seems. This place must have been in insulation for a long time.
710089=A blood trail over there. It's recent. It might lead us to Natalie.
710090=What the hell happened to this Station? Why is Dr. Gallo involved?
710091=Let's move on. Natalie might have all the answers.
710092=Check out those signs. That's not good.
710093=Looks like some kinda warning.
710094=It says, "Warning, the extremely dangerous Subject 04 has escaped Dr. Gallo's lab."
710095=Subject 04? It all makes sense now. This must be where Dr. Strange did all his experiments.
710096=So the door we encountered earlier was to keep Subject 04 away?
710097=I don't believe Doc would perform experiments on zombies. They're "living" dead after all! He's an honorable man!
710098=Something big is behind all this, a conspiracy! I can sense it with my genius perception!
710099=Natalie, we found you at last!
710100=Bout time! I could use some help with this big guy.
710101=Is he Subject 04?
710102=Watch out!
710103=Thank god. Are you okay, Natalie?
710104=I can't believe this! Natalie, what are you looking for in this damn forsaken place?!
710105=A family photo...
710106=A photo of you and Dr. Gallo?
710107=A family photo of Dr. Gallo, his wife, a boy, and a little girl.
710108=Fernando told us Dr. Gallo is your foster father. So you're the little girl!
710109=That's right. Years ago, Dr. Gallo and his wife adopted me and another boy at this very Fortress.
710110=You might also have guessed it. The boy was Enrique, the leader of Vindicators.
710111=Doctor left Zeus with his wife and continued his research in this hidden Fortress.
710112=Hoping, one day, to save humanity with a cure.
710113=What happened then? Why is this place deserted? What happened to you?
710114=Enrique happened. He staged a coup right after our father's success.
710115=And that photo was our last family memory before he went rogue.
710116=I don't understand. Why would he stage a coup when we all could get a cure?
710117=So did you find the photo?
710118=It should be in this room...
710119=There, the photo...
710120=Yes. This is the one... Wait...
710121=So which one is you?
710122=Idiot! She's not in it.
710123=I was right there in this corner of the photo...that now had been torn off...
710124=So you never contacted them after you were sent away? I mean Mr. And Mrs. Gallo.
710125=No, I've never heard from them ever since. But I never expect...
710126=If I remember right, there is another photo of us in the room downstairs! Can you guys...
710127=We're here for you!
710128=Not me! I don't wanna go there.
710129=Fine then. Just don't come begging for food the following week!
710130=On second thought...
710131=Thank you, guys. The stairs to the lower level are just next door. Let's go.
710132=So far, so good. Where do we start to look?
710133=The longer we linger, the greater the danger. Let's split up and hurry.
710134=No, no, no. I don't wanna be alone! I'll get scared!
710135=Quiet, Fernando!
710136=It's okay, Fernando. You go with Natalie. I'll go with Emma.
710137=Put a sock in it, and man up, Fernando!
710138=We'll go this way. Let us know if you find anything.
710139=Okay. Be careful.
710140=What...?
710141=Two dead bodies. They've been here for a while.
710142=How creepy... A zombie, female...
710143=And a human...male.
710144=There are no signs of fighting, and the scene is not messy.
710145=A couple! But how?! A zombie and a human?!
710146=Check this out.
710147=A vial? What does it say?
710148="Anti-Virus Sample C; Effective in Suppressing the Mutated Zombie Virus; Dr. Gallo"
710149=Does it mean Doctor succeeded in making an anti-virus serum?
710150=I believe, yes. I think you're right about these two bodies.
710151=Are you saying the serum prevented the deterioration and kept her from attacking the man?
710152=That's one way to explain it.
710153=What a tragic end to die here while the Fortress was thrown into a chaotic rebellion...
710154=Indeed... Wait! Did you hear that?
710155=Anti-Virus Sample C
710156=Developed by Dr. Gallo to suppress the mutated zombie virus. Unfortunately, though, the effect has been lost to time.
710157=In the meantime...
710158=Natalie! Natalie? I can't see anything. Where are you, Natalie?
710159=I swear I was just with her two seconds ago.
710160=What's this?
710161=Is this... The blueprint of the Subway!
710162=According to the blueprint, Brady and Emma should be in the room on the left. I'm at the staircase...
710163=Natalie should be in the room on the right if I'm not mistaken.
710164=That's...the lab! Crap! I got a bad feeling about this!
710165=Fernando, it's just you? Where is Natalie?
710166=Finally, you two are here. Look what I found, a blueprint!
710167=Natalie left me when I was checking the blueprint. She should be in the room on the right!
710168=Are you sure? Let's get to her, then.
710169=Subway Blueprint
710170=A blueprint of the subway shows many reinforced structures to prevent test subjects from escaping.
710171=Family Photo
710172=A photo of Mr. and Mrs. Gallo and their adopted son and daughter depicts a loving family in the good old days...
710173=Warning Poster
710174=Warning, Subject 04 has escaped the lab!
710175=This photo looks so...familiar...
710176=The photo Natalie showed us. This is the other part that got torn off! Let's put it together!
710177=Don't worry, Natalie. We'll always be there for you!
710178=The car is fixed. Shall we go?
710179=Let's go, Natalie. We'll find Dr. Gallo together!
710180=Okay, Let's do this!
710181=They died in each other's arms. No struggle... It's just like...
710182=Well, guess the result didn't turn out as he expected...
710183=Let's not jump to conclusions just yet. Natalie might tell us the truth after we find her.
710184=He wanted to rule the Fortress with it, to have power and all!
710185=Father would never let that happen. That's why Enrique resorted to a different plan...
710186=So even Dr. Gallo couldn't bring out the bright side of Enrique. His wickedness only grows with age!
710187=She's always the cautious one. She knows how dangerous that place is!
710188=Saying Dr. Gallo was her foster father and she could handle herself in the subway. And then she just left...
710189=You have not cleared the Subway stages and are not able to start the exploration.
710190=I'm glad that I was adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Gallo.
710191=Well, Enrique did not seem to be very happy about that.
710192=If Dr. Gallo's experiment works out, perhaps we could really save the world.
710193=But Enrique wanted to monopolize the vaccines for power and money. That's how our argument started.
710194=I saw Enrique switched some vaccines. A catastrophe was looming on the horizon.
710195=The wrong vaccines led to a zombie crisis in the Fortress. Another period of chaos hence began.
710196=Worse still, my foster mother contracted the zombie virus. Dr. Gallo had to send me away. Enrique disappeared as well.
710197=Unlocks at Fortress Lv. 7
710200=According to the radar, Rebecca is trapped in this building.
710201=Let's go rescue her immediately!
710202=Watch out! Zombies ahead!
710203=Check this out. Fresh footprints. Someone was here.
710204=Let's look around.
710205=Recent handprint on this chest. Someone opened it not long ago.
710206=It must've been Rebecca. She beat us here.
710207=The ladder leading down is cleared. Let's go down and have a look.
710208=The collapsed <color=#ae6e55>blocks</color> are in our way.
710209=Don't sweat it just yet. There's an abandoned tool shed.
710210=Once it's <color=#ae6e55>repaired</color>, we should find the tool for excavation.
710211=Well, all yours.
710212=Perfect. Let's go <color=#ae6e55>excavate</color> a way out.
710213=Careful, I heard zombies growling up ahead.
710214=It's mutated. Looks like it's protecting something. Keep your guard up!
710215=The marker on the chest is the symbol the Minutemen use to mark their way! Rebecca must be right ahead.
710216=Don't sweat it just yet. Look! Here's a Work Station.
710217=Rebecca! At last! Are you hurt?
710218=Natalie! Thank god you got my distress signal.
710219=I was investigating the survivors' gathering place when I encountered mutated zombies.
710220=Their attacks caused the blocks to collapse. If it weren't for you, I...!!!
710221=Sorry to interrupt. How about we save the rest after we get back to the Fortress?
710222=Our surroundings are about to collapse at any moment.
710223=You're right. Everyone at the Fortress will be happy to see you again.
710224=After a while...
710225=The whole room is cluttered with junk.
710226=Let's clean it up and see if we can find anything.
710227=Brady, I found a chest here.
710228=Help! I'm here!
710230=Crap. The road is blocked.
710231=Let's see if we can find some handy tools.
710232=Look what I found! A pickaxe!
710233=Now let's go rescue Rebecca!
710234=Pickaxe
710235=A durable pickaxe that can be used to break any hard clods
710236=Let's continue our exploration.
710237=What's that...?
710238=It's Rebecca's bag. The strap probably was ripped apart in a battle.
710239=Let's head down as fast as possible!
710240=Lost Bag
710241=The strap was ripped apart. It probably was dropped by her in a haste.
710300=According to the radar, Chihiro Fujiwara is trapped in this building.
710301=It must've been Chihiro. She beat us here.
710302=The marker is the symbol the Minutemen use to mark their way! Chihiro must be right ahead.
710303=Chihiro! At last! Are you hurt?
710304=Welcome back, Chihiro! How have you been?
710305=Sorry. No time for small talk.
710306=Remember that building I was trapped in when I was investigating the survivors' gathering place?
710307=Using the Fortress radar, I picked up my brother's distress signal from there. I must go find him.
710308=Let's not waste any time, then. We can catch up later after we rescue Chihiro's brother!
710309=You're safe, Diana. Now that we got you out, the Fortress will protect you.
710310=Thank god! I couldn't take it anymore... Those Vindicators... They're a bunch of lunatics!
710311=Anyway, you have my eternal gratitude! I'll do whatever I can to repay your kindness!
710312=It's okay, Diana. People at the Fortress are all nice and friendly. No more Vindicators.
710313=Now let's go rescue Chihiro!
710314=It's Chihiro's bag. The strap probably was ripped apart in a battle.
710400=Help! Help!
710401=Please keep calm and tell me what happened.
710402=I'm Helen, a researcher at Zeus Group. This is the Laboratory of Ruins! We were attacked by zombies!
710403=Are you the only one here? Any other survivors?
710404=And Dr. Wolowitz! He's injured. Just over there. Please help us!
710405=Alright. Please take me there.
710406=Wolowitz, how are you? Are you okay?
710407=I'm fine. I was there when the zombies attacked, but luckily I only hurt my leg.
710408=If I were bitten...the consequences could be tragic. Who is this?
710409=Let me introduce, this is Dr. Wolowitz, a key member of the Laboratory, and this is...
710410=And, what's your name, please?
710411=I'm Palmer. I'm here to investigate the accident. Can you give me a detailed account of what happened?
710412=Zeus Group discovered alien ruins that did not belong to Earth during resource extraction, and then discovered genetic modification technology after further research. As a result, the group organized a research team of experts from all over the world and gradually developed as many as a hundred laboratories.
710413=In conjunction with the militaries of various countries, Zeus Group genetically engineered soldiers, allowing the experiment to progress quickly. However, the situation deteriorated rapidly as cases of engineered human variation arose in experimental bases in various regions. Within six months, the zombie virus had spread rapidly around the world...
710414=This is how it happened...
710415=So instead of being attacked by zombies, we actually created them...
710416=...
710417=Is there a safe zone around here that you're familiar with? I'll get you there.
710418=Dr. Gallo appears to have gone to the Ark Safe Zone, which is the closest safe zone.
710419=It's better for us to meet up with Dr. Gallo as soon as possible.
710420=But there are zombies all around. What should we do?
710421=Don't worry. I'll handle them. Stay close to me.
710422=We're safe now. Wolowitz, do you feel better?
710423=Thank you so much, Palmer. Please help us with a very important thing!
710424=Wait! Are you sure you want to tell her about this?
710425=I believe Ms. Palmer can be trusted. She saved us and she is very capable, isn't she?
710426=Alright. Ms. Palmer, our Laboratory has developed a preliminary viral vaccine.
710427=It's right in the drop location ahead, and it's really important to us!
710428=Wait! You mean, like, a vaccine for the zombie virus?
710429=Yes, it could neutralize the zombie virus before the infected went mutant.
710430=But we only succeeded to a limited extent. This batch of vaccines needs to be sent to a safe place ASAP!
710431=But why would Zeus Group develop a vaccine while it's striving to develop genetic modification?
710432=It's a long story. Let's go check the vaccine first!
710433=Looks like it's an empty box.
710434=Are you sure it's here? It seems to be no vaccine here...
710435=This should be the right place. Why isn't Dr. Gallo here? He won't be in danger, right?
710436=There are no signs of any fighting here, and this location was known only to a few of us.
710437=Maybe we arrived here late and Dr. Gallo went to the next institute with the vaccine.
710438=If so, I'm relieved. And how's your leg?
710439=...if my injury hadn't slowed us down, we would have met up with Gallo.
710440=Don't care that much. I'll get you to a nearby safe zone for treatment.
710441=If you trust me, I'll help you find Dr. Gallo.
710442=Really? Thank you so much. I'll give you the follow-up data when we get to the safe zone.
710443=Here we are. This is the largest safe zone around the Ruins Laboratory.
710444=Thank you for helping us all the way, Ms. Palmer.
710445=My question might not be polite, but...Why do you want to help us? And why are you investigating this matter?
710446=Because I am a Lawbringer. We are Lawbringers. It is our duty to make the world develop in order...
710447=Help me!
710448=Oh, no! Wolowitz's injury was aggravated!
710449=I remember there were medical supplies nearby...
710450=10 years ago, the initial stage of the virus hitting
710451=You mean...your guys?
710452=Anyway, thank you very much for your help. This is the address of the next Laboratory. Please find Dr. Gallo.
710453=That's true! Ms. Palmer, the vaccine Dr. Gallo possessed is vital to this dire situation.
710454=OK. I'll keep that address in mind. You may rest assured. Take good care of yourselves.
710455=Looks like it's an empty laboratory.
710456=It seems like people here have been relocated.
710457=What is Zeus Group covering up?
710458=Please help me!
710459=You got hurt. Are you alright? Why are you here alone?
710460=I'm Grace. I work at Gallo Laboratory.
710461=I accidentally cut my arm when I was being chased by zombies. Don't worry about me.
710462=You mean, you're Dr. Gallo's assistant?
710463=Yes. Unfortunately, a huge wave of zombies popped up around here, then Dr. Gallo and I got separated.
710464=Do you know where Dr. Gallo went? Or do you have an agreed destination?
710465=If that's what you're asking...
710466=By the way, I guess I didn't get a chance to thank you for your help, and I don't know your name.
710467=I'm Palmer, coming from the ruins, and I met a lot of employees of Zeus Group along the way.
710468=Don't worry. I'm here to investigate the cause of those zombies, and you can trust me.
710469=I see. But where are you going to investigate it now?
710470=I heard Dr. Gallo was carrying the key vaccine for the zombie virus, and I was on my way to find him.
710471=Yes, he is at the institute ahead. But my arm...
710472=Don't worry. I see an airdrop of medical kits ahead. Follow me, please.
710473=Where are you going?
710474=(Why did she leave without saying a word?)
710475=(Looks like I'm treated as a badass. What has happened to human beings?)
710476=(As things stand, the zombie vaccine seems to be a secret project, and I need to gain Helen's trust.)
710477=Sorry. I was anxious to check on Dr. Gallo.
710478=That's fine, but it looks like we're still too late.
710479=Now can you tell me about Dr. Gallo?
710480=Dr. Gallo was the first to discover the genetic modification in the ruins.
710481=But soon after he started researching the technology, he saw its pitfalls.
710482=But Zeus Group didn't care, saying the tech is just "not ready" now, then began plenty of experiments at once.
710483=So Dr. Gallo began working on a technique to reverse the genetic modification, which is the vaccine.
710484=But his worst fears were realized.
710485=So Dr. Gallo's technique is still a secret, right?
710486=Well, it was a secret, but looks like it's not anymore.
710487=Why would you say so?
710488=Apparently, the institute has been exposed.
710489=All the survivors who knew about the vaccine were planning to loot the "secret".
710490=Like what you said, we're too late. The vaccines here have been looted.
710491=Why hide these vaccines? The survivors are really in need of these vaccines right now.
710492=No, Dr. Gallo's plan is to distribute the vaccines to different factions of survivors.
710493=I see. I can help you if you would like to trust me.
710494=There's a secret location nearby where the vaccine is kept.
710495=But it's been exposed, and if you can help me keep these vaccines, I'll trust you.
710496=Let's go.
710497=Oh, no! They are coming for the vaccine!
710498=Don't worry. I'll never let them take it.
710499=Phew...Luckily we got there in time, no, I mean, luckily you are here.
710500=You hurt?
710501=It's okay. I'm not hurt. Oh, good. The vaccines are safe, too.
710502=Now you can trust me?
710503=Sure. Up until just now, I was desperate, but now I can trust you with the vaccine.
710504=That's all right with me. So what's next? What's your plan?
710505=Let's split up from here. I went to Dr. Gallo as planned.
710506=I'll leave the planned vaccine delivery to you, Ms. Palmer!
710507=OK.
710508=The Stations of those factions are too far from here.
710509=I have to figure out a way. How do I get there...
710510=...
710511=There's a call button! Fix it, then I should be able to call in the vehicle of Zeus Group.
710512=It's finally fixed. Let me see where the first stop is...
710513=The clan of Wildlings.
710514=Wait. You are...?
710515=Get out of my way! I saw this vehicle with vaccines first! (impatient)
710516=...Hi, I'm Palmer. It was meant to be the vaccine delivered to Wildlings.
710517=What? Tut. You must have been sent by Gallo...the flunkies of Zeus Group! Bah!
710518=Oh, you got me wrong. I'm not...
710519=You listen to me. I don't care who you are. It was I who found the vaccines.
710520=You want to complete your delivery mission? Just send another box of vaccines. Haha...
710521=Are you...robbing me?
710522=Shut up! Robbing Zeus Group is not robbing! Hand it over!
710523=(Looks like Zeus Group has a bad reputation at Wildlings...)
710524=(What's next? Let me see...it's Minutemen.)
710525=Hi, comrade! I'm Alisa from Minutemen.
710526=Please stop. I need details about you and the vaccine.
710527=I'm Palmer from Lawbringers. I'm here to investigate the cause of the zombies.
710528=I've been requested by Dr. Gallo's Laboratory to deliver vaccines to four Factions.
710529=I see. Thanks for your hard work, Ms. Palmer. And thank you for the vaccine!
710530=Oh, by the way, is Dr. Gallo fine?
710531=Unfortunately, I haven't met up with Dr. Gallo. He got separated from Grace among the zombies.
710532=But Grace is on her way to Dr. Gallo, so I'm sure we'll hear from them soon.
710533=Dr. Gallo is sure to come through it. We'll take the vaccines and distribute them to the survivors in the camp.
710534=Speaking of zombies, Minutemen recently found some intel. I don't know if it works for Ms. Palmer.
710535=We don't know if the intel is useful until we hear it. Please.
710536=These days, Minutemen frequently received help messages, and there is a common feature in these cases.
710537=They were all attacked by a monster that is half-human and half-zombie.
710538=It first appeared near a laboratory of Zeus Group.
710539=Half-human and half-zombie? (pondering)
710540=Thank you. This is a very useful clue!
710541=I'm glad it's useful. Ms. Palmer, thank you for your help!
710542=I'm starting to investigate the monster. Until next time, see you, Alisa.
710543=...(handing over the vaccines)
710544=...(skeptical face)
710545=Just say it.
710546=Hello, this is Palmer from Lawbringers. And this is the vaccine for you.
710547=Lawbringers? Just name your price.
710548=Is there some kind of misunderstanding? I'm here to deliver the vaccine for Dr. Gallo...
710549=Gallo? Ah, he should be responsible for this zombie virus. Now he's crying crocodile tears?
710550=You're working with him? So you're not a good one. Leave the vaccines and get out of here!
710551=...I'm Palmer from Lawbringers. I don't know Mr. Gallo. And Lawbringers is...
710552=Is what? I know who you are. You call yourself the protector of order. Nothing but impractical. Idiot.
710553=I guess I don't have to explain myself. Have you seen any monster which is half-human and half-zombie recently?
710554=Monster? The biggest monster I've seen recently is you, isn't it?
710555=Preserve order...Really funny. Where were you when the zombies broke out?
710556=Now pretend to be good. Why would you need a parachute if the plane already crashed? Get as far away as you can!
710557=...then goodbye.
710558=Hello, I'm David, one of the Watchers.
710559=Hi, I'm Palmer. In the car is the vaccine Gallo requested me to deliver here.
710560=Much appreciated. With all due respect, are you Palmer from Lawbringers?
710561=Yes, Mr. David. You know about us?
710562=Certainly. But what are your ideas for dealing with the current crisis, Ms. Palmer?
710563=Dr. Gallo has developed a vaccine. We can widely distribute the vaccine from the perspective of prevention.
710564=But Mr. David, if you asked so, do you think there's a better way?
710565=There is no unified belief in the world today, and people are not of one mind.
710566=People are suspicious of each other. There are many serious obstacles to popularizing the vaccine.
710567=You must have experienced this, Ms. Palmer.
710568=Yes, I've been to three camps before, and people have different attitudes toward the vaccine.
710569=It's important to bring together as many survivors as possible to exploit the advantages of human strengths.
710570=You're right, Mr. David. Then there should be a safe, large place to shelter the survivors.
710571=As far as I know, there is a highly secured system at Eden, which attracted many survivors.
710572=But in Apocalypse, it's hard for survivors to find the way. If we can light Eden's beam, we can do more with less.
710573=I see. Thank you, Mr. David. By the way, have you heard anything strange around here recently?
710574=Are you talking about the monster which is half-zombie and half-human?
710575=Yes. Have you seen it, Mr. David?
710576=I heard that a monster recently appeared near the Everest community, the largest human community. You can go there.
710577=Here's what happens.
710578=Everest community?...
710579=I can go there next.
710580=Can anyone help me? I would give you anything you want!
710581=Please stay calm. Is there anything I can do for you? Take it easy.
710582=I got separated from my family!
710583=My brother and I made an appointment to go to the Everest community, but...
710584=On the way there we met a hideous, scary monster!
710585=Half-human and half-zombie. Is that what you're talking about?
710586=Yes, it is! They say it's brutal, bloodthirsty, and murderous!
710587=My brother and I got separated trying to avoid it. I am very concerned for his safety.
710588=But we common survivors have no means of communication, so we can't communicate with each other in time.
710589=If you could help me find my brother, I'll give you all supplies I have left!
710590=I don't need your supplies. I will help you. Just tell me where the monster appeared.
710591=I will light Eden's lights as a signal.
710592=After that, you take the survivors of the Everest community to Eden, where you will be reunited with your brother.
710593=OK. Thank you very much!
710594=(According to the resident's directions, the monster is right ahead.)
710595=(I need to deal with this threat as soon as possible, then light the lights of Eden...)
710596=...it's you!
710597=I've been looking for you for a long time.
710598=What a coincidence. So do I!
710599=Let the survivor go!
710600=Ugh...(groaning)
710601=Why don't you just kill me?
710602=You...are you a human being or a zombie?
710603=What? You can't kill me because I'm a human being?
710604=I should have killed you!
710605=If you kill me, I will kill this wretch.
710606=No!
710607=Calm down. You can leave, but you have to let the survivor go!
710608=Hahaha...deal!
710609=Thank you. You saved me.
710610=Your brother asked me to come. He was worried about you.
710611=Come on. Let's light up Eden. So the survivors would gather.
710612=Thank you. We are saved!
710613=Hurry up! It's our big day!
710614=Where is Cloud? We agreed to take this vaccine together!
710615=Shh! The vaccine heist is our secret plan. Don't let anyone hear about it.
710616=I know. Gallo is the only one protecting this batch of vaccine for Zeus Group. It is a piece of cake.
710617=Let's go find Cloud. He went ahead to sniff around.
710618=Okay.
710619=Whew... If you're any late, I'll be eaten by zombies!
710620=Hey! Where were you just now? Do you want to monopolize the vaccine?
710621=Listen! According to the latest news, there's been a fire at the branch of Zeus Group.
710622=That place is a mess. It's our chance to loot. Haha!
710623=Ugh...
710624=Oh, my god! Shit! Soros has been bitten!
710625=Damn it! This is not a good time to get injured!
710626=What should we do now? If we don't get there, it'll be too late...
710627=Help me...Ugh...
710628=Just ignore him and get over there. He's gonna die anyway.
710629=What...Damn it!
710630=Ugh! Help me! Patrick! Please...
710631=How are you feeling? Soros! Hey! Answer me...
710632=I...I feel something happening in my body...
710633=Hang in there. We're on our way to a vaccine stronghold ahead.
710634=Mmm...
710635=Something has to be done about this sticky situation...
710636=Oh, no! Zombies are coming again!
710637=Quick! Shoot it up!
710638=I had one shot. But I don't think it worked...
710639=What? Damn it! The zombies are closing in.
710640=Soros, we did the best we could...Good luck.
710641=What do you mean?
710642=We are in the Doomsday! We can only be responsible for ourselves!
710643=Patrick took all the rest of the vaccine.
710644=Damn it! They deserted me!
710645=<size=30>I must revenge myself to those who betrayed me!</size>
710646=Where is Cloud?
710647=Help! Help!
710648=I remember there is a stronghold of Zeus Group ahead.
710649=I hope Cloud didn't take all the vaccine...
710650=Soros? No! No way! Why are you still awake?
710651=You were bitten by the zombie...Oh, my god! Monster! Get the hell away from me!
710652=You betrayed me. I'll never forgive you! I'm going to kill you...
710653=Stop it! You want the vaccine? Go through me.
710654=Help! Help me! This monster is trying to kill me.
710655=I thought you guys were after the vaccine. Turns out you're infected.
710656=The one who's not infected, get out of here! He can't be saved.
710657=OK. I'm leaving right now...
710658=How are you feeling? Let me take a look at your wound.
710659=He betrayed me! Why did you let him go?
710660=You can think logically. Looks like you can still be saved.
710661=...
710662=Let me see your wound.
710663=Why did you save me?
710664=That's all I can do. The rest is up to you.
710665=If you feel like you can survive as a human being, go get your friends to help you.
710666=But if you feel like you're going to turn into a zombie, stay away from the survivors.
710667=I...
710668=How are you still alive?
710669=Sorry to disappoint you. I'm not dead yet! I'll take you with me if I die!
710670=What are you doing? Stop it, you hideous monster!
710671=What happened?
710672=What are you doing to my friend, you monster!
710673=Watch out, Betty! He has lost his mind!
710674=Oh, my friends? They are just people who left me behind when we are in danger.
710675=You're gonna die right here!
710676=I'll let you taste how it feels when no one will come to help!
710677=You're gonna lose all your friends! Soros, you'll regret it!
710678=Oh, speaking of friends...It's time to settle some old scores with Cloud.
710679=No. He will lose his human nature if he continues.
710680=I need to find a way to stop him...
710681=This is the first time a human being bitten by zombies didn't completely mutate.
710682=I'll ask the boss for help.
710683=Oh my God! What an ugly creature! It's so ugly! Ugly as hell!
710684=Hey! Are you talking about me, old woman? Don't you dare say that again?
710685=Human has finally angered the Nature! This is what will eventually happen to all human beings!
710686=Genetic modification is the forbidden Pandora's Box! And you are the devil that the box unleashed!
710687=Crazy woman, call Cloud out, or you all die together!
710688=Oh, my god! Soros, how did you ever get like this?
710689=The catastrophe! Mankind will eventually face the catastrophe of its own making!
710690=Cloud, are you surprised to see me like this?
710691=It's all your fault! Take the consequences!
710692=Oh, no, zombies! We need to retreat!
710693=Run, Jessie! Stay away from him!
710694=<size=30>Go to hell!!</size>
710695=No...my body...
710696=Hurry up! Leave now!
710697=There is a constant flow of energy coming out...Ugh! I'm about to lose control!
710698=Those zombies...they don't attack me anymore.
710699=I can't go on like this. I have to ask for help!
710700=Oh, Minutemen! They will find a way to help me!
710701=Please help me...Don't be afraid. I'm human.
710702=May I ask what happened to you?
710703=I was bitten by a zombie. I've had two shots of the vaccine.
710704=The virus is barely under control, but I feel like I'm losing control of my body...
710705=Please help me! I just want a dose of the vaccine!
710706=You may rest assured that we will do our best to help you. Please follow me...
710707=You...This is a part of your conspiracy!
710708=I didn't realize that even the Minutemen were just a bunch of phony guys!
710709=Hahahaha. Well, I'm not human in your eyes anymore!
710710=No, Soros. Listen to me...We are here to help you.
710711=But for the safety of the rest of the Minutemen, we need to take you somewhere else.
710712=You should've known that when you left after I was bitten by a zombie.
710713=I'll never believe anything you say. Go to hell!
710714=This is all because of that vaccine!
710715=If I hadn't gone for the vaccine, I wouldn't have been bitten by that damn zombie!
710716=If I hadn't gotten the shot, I wouldn't be in this half-human, half-zombie mess...
710717=And that Palmer! Yes...It's her fault!
710718=I have to find her!
710719=Hey, loser! Have you ever seen a woman who dresses in a high-flown style?
710720=Ah! Monster!
710721=Crap, he got away!
710722=You! What are you doing? Don't hurt me! Don't kill me!
710723=Have you ever heard of Palmer?
710724=Palmer...Palmer...She...
710725=A woman with hair glows gold. You remember?
710726=She...She went to Watchers base! I don't know anything else! Please don't kill me!
710727=Get Palmer out, or I'll tear this place down!
710728=I've been waiting for you.
710729=What?
710730=Damn it! I was caught in your ambush!
710731=Miss Palmer is on an important mission here.
710732=We waited here early to ensure that she would not be disturbed.
710733=Call her out! Tell her to come out!
710734=Everything I'm suffering is because of her!
710735=Your suffering is only because you let yourself fall into the abyss
710736=Dragging others into the abyss doesn't change the fact that you're in it
710737=That's easy for you to say. You're not the one being spurned.
710738=Tell Palmer. I'll keep killing people until she comes to see me!
710739=I will make those who betrayed and abandoned me pay with their blood!
710740=(This is Eden. Almost get picked on by those Watchers...)
710741=(This is where I'm gonna get my dignity back!)
710742=(With all these guards in Eden all of a sudden, there must be a lot of vaccines!)
710743=(Then I will destroy these vaccines. My suffering must be shared!)
710744=You again. Out of the way. Must I kill you?
710745=Soros, stop it. It was our fault for leaving you behind.
710746=But Eden was the last hope for mankind from Palmer.
710747=If you destroy it, you will be the enemy of all the survivors!
710748=It's not too late to stop!
710749=Easy for you to say. Look at my gray-blue skin! Who would treat me as a human being?
710750=The scared survivors want to get away from me, and no one will accept me!
710751=But... Since you mentioned Palmer...
710752=Then I'll kill your savior first, and give you all the sense of despair! Hahahahaha!
710753=What should we do? Soros is going after Palmer.
710754=Our job is to protect Eden.
710755=The battle between Soros and Palmer is beyond our reach...
710756=God, I just want it to end on a happy note.
710757=(What should I do to draw Palmer out?)
710758=(So far, she seems to have spoken of benevolence and compassion for the survivors.)
710759=(Okay, then I'll give her a "good opportunity".)
710760=Guess if your savior will be here on time? I'm really curious about it.
710761=I heard you've saved a lot of people, the savior.
710762=I heard you've killed a lot of people.
710763=Yeah...I've killed a lot of people. Do you regret it? You didn't kill me...
710764=Why are you doing this? What is your purpose?
710765=Now you care about me? Don't you think you're being hypocritical? I hate you so much!
710766=It's all your fault! You made me look like this!
710767=You gave me a shot of the vaccine! It gave me hope, and it plunged me into despair!
710768=Didn't you save a lot of people? Why didn't you save me?
710769=I gave you the right to make your own choice.
710770=Bullshit! You didn't save me completely, and you wouldn't kill me.
710771=You're the biggest liar in the world! I'm gonna expose you and destroy you!

710798=My memory of the global catastrophe \nbegins with a fire...\nThe human desire for power and wealth is like a constant build-up of gunpowder, \nwhich will eventually ignite this chaotic world.\nThe order is failing. Let's go back and see what it was like then.
710799=Wealth itself is a fictional concept.\nBut for the sake of these ethereal things, \nhuman beings constantly and wantonly destroy the order.\nEveryone involved in the research seemed not to understand the consequences \nuntil the disaster struck.
710800=When the order breaks down, so does trust between humans.\nWhat do I need to do to rebuild the trust?\nSomething that should be indestructible \nmust not be covered up...
710801=It seems that the human race is not hopeless, \nand that the forerunners among the human race are the antidote to this scourge.\nIt is imperative to find the forerunners, protect them, \nand help them understand the order...
710802=I used to think that organization and hope were a bunch of meaningless nouns, \nbut it was only then that I came to understand that \nhuman survival depends on those meanings.\nAfter all, the organization also helps innocent survivors gain hope.
710803=It has always seemed difficult for me to understand the meaning of regret, \nbut the mere mention of a person's name \nseems to awaken similar feelings in me.\nBack then he was called a monster \nand I missed the chance to redeem him...
710804=It seemed then that I had finally found a way \ncould restore the order.\nAll I need is a signal \nto spread the message of hope like a seed through a lighthouse, \nto plant the seed of hope for people and lead them...
710805=Seeing this Palmer again \nreminds me of the humiliating experience \nI had before!\nOr, in other words, the memory of being a human.\nBack then, we had a plan...
710806=At that time, I thought I was doomed. \nThe abandonment and betrayal of my companions made me fall to the bottom.\nI even prayed for gods and miracles, \nat least back then, I believed in them.\nAll the things I hoped for turned out to be \nthe final straw.
710807=I used to think of Palmer as the god of my dreams.\nBut like the devil, she gave me a choice I couldn't finish.\nHer self-righteous salvation is pushing me into the abyss...
710808=Mankind will eventually face the aftermath of its own making.\nYes, but the definition of the aftermath is different for everyone...\nI believed I had passed the bottom,\nbut at that time, I didn't know where I was going.
710809=If the suffering is only my suffering after all, \nI can't get rid of it anyway.\nPerhaps by turning it into a nightmare for all,\nI can wake up. I am waking up...
710810=I am the chosen one, \nand the power bestowed upon me will give me a new identity!\nI'm the supposed savior.\nWatch as I crush your hopes with my own hands, \nalong with the one I once had...
710811=Damn it! How could she do that?\nShe's the one who ruined everything!\nNo...I'm not ruined!\nOnly I stand for what is right!\nWho said abyss cannot be another kind of peak!
710812=Hey! I think I just heard the sound of fireworks.
710813=It's almost the first anniversary of the Fortress! To show my gratitude for all your hard work in the past year,
710814=we've prepared some fireworks to celebrate all the amazing events here. Come, I'll show you!
710815=You can preview all details of the anniversary events here. Tap the anniversary facility to check out.
710816=When there is an event taking place, be sure to come and join in the fun!
710817=We wish you a happy and enjoyable time!
711001=Welcome to our Fortress. Everyone's alright?
711002=I've seen worse.
711003=Definitely- definitely seen worse.
711004=Yeah, much better now.
711005=So Starlight, what brings you to our little corner of the apocalypse?
711006=Are you sure we're completely alone?
711007=Why? What's up?
711008=You can't trust Vought.
711009=What do you mean?
711010=Butcher here has been investigating Vought's corruption for years now.
711011=Long story short, Homelander is a psychopath. Vought's a bunch of evil tossers.
711012=Homelander just saved our lives.
711013=And nothing else happened, that was all?
711014=One of the guards got caught in the crossfire.
711015=But that was an accident.
711016=Nothing is ever accidental with Homelander. We think he's trying to cover something up.
711017=Have you got any evidence?
711018=We're still working on it. Of course, it would be better if you could help us on this.
711019=No problem! If Homelander and Vought have anything to do with this outbreak, we want to help you stop them.
711020=Hey, guys! Check this out. The radar picked something up.
711021=Well, we got ain't got all day. What is it?
711022=I'm not totally sure. But it looks like a large building.
711023=Can we trust this old piece of junk?
711024=Holy-- That's where we saw all the Vought personnel.
711025=If that's a Vought blacksite, then that's where we'll find the flying knobber.
711026=What are we waiting for?
711027=This is insane.
711028=It's Vought, luv, what'd ya expect?
711029=But what do we know for sure?
711030=The intel shows the Vought experiments were not stable.
711031=They were playing with fire.
711032=You mean playing with toxic chemicals and unleashing an army of flesh eating dead kicking off an apocalypse?
711033=But we don't know what ignited it. Keep working, guys. Clock's ticking.
711034=Hey guys, look we got the coordinates.
711035=Does this location look familiar to you, Natalie?
711036=Wait--
711037=That's Eden!
711038=Oh my god. It actually does make sense in a way. I just can't believe it.
711039=What? Spit it out luv.
711040=Eden has been known as the safe haven, but that never made sense since the place was crawling with zombies.
711041=We thought it was because of the survivors inside.
711042=But now we know it's actually a secret Vought base.
711043=If that means what I think it means--
711044=Means we're heading straight into the belly of the beast.
711045=How's Butcher?
711046=I gave him the shot of Temp V.
711047=How do you feel Butcher?
711048=Brady and Natalie, thanks for helping us.
711049=Oy, cut the lovey dovey pillow talk. I'm right as rain. It's just my eyes.
711050=Can you see?
711051=It's not that. Just stay back!
711052=Woah, that's dope, man!
711053=Now we stand a chance against Homelander.
711054=Homelander's indestructible. We need to avoid him at all costs
711055=I still luv a chance to shove my crow bar where the sun don't shine.
711056=Let's just try not to get ourselves killed.
711057=Let's get ready and then head to Eden.
711058=Are we all set?
711059=Almost done. The radar shows Homelander is in Eden right now!
711060=We gotta let the survivors in Eden get out first. We don't know what Homelander could do to them.
711061=What survivors? If Eden's a lab for V, they're either zombies or dead.
711062=Wait you guys, I just remembered there's a restricted underground area in Eden
711063=Yeah, she's right. It was always totally inaccessible to the public.
711064=Sounds like we found our X marks the spot.
711065=Hang in there!!
711066=Brady! I'm runnin' out of ammo. We need back up. Stat!
711067=Should be here any minute.
711068=You see all these zombies, we don't have minutes. We got seconds at most.
711069=Good job!
711070=Thanks for your help!
711071=Saving fellow patriots is what gets me up in the morning.
711072=Guys! I'm not getting anything.
711073=They told me the power would have been fixed already.
711074=Damn it Hughie! Can't even handle a phone call….
711075=Sorry about the delay. Power is coming back now.
711076=We have the evidence. Vought's behind the outbreak.
711077=Their Compound V experiments turned all the test subjects into zombies.
711078=So what do we do now?
711079=We go back to the fortress and grab every weapon we can.
711080=Let's take 'em all dow.
711081=Oh no…
711082=Watch out!
711083="Hang on, Butcher!"
711084=This is it.
711085=Time is ticking. Let’s spilt up.
711086=Alright.
711087=No time like the present to end this once and for all.
711088=Oh another tough guy here. Who do you think you are?
711089=The place is so creepy.
711090=Yep. I feel so weird.
711091=Look! Something's over there!
711092=Watch out!
711093=You hear that?
711094=I think the sound is from somewhere there.
711095=I can hear some heavy steps and low growls.
711096=Looks like it's where classified files are stored.
711097=That's the only clue we have so far.
711098=Let's head down to check the floor below.
711099=Here we are.
711100=Time is ticking. Let’s split up.
711101=Okay.
711102=Look. Here are some supplies of Vought and samples from their failed experiments.
711103=Which means what we found out before was true. Let's go find Starlight now!
711104=Sure. No idea what's goin' on there.
711105=What the f...
711106=Annie January is as down-to-earth and sincere as they come. \nOriginally "The Defender of Des Moines", her dreams came true with a meteoric rise to The Seven. \nAll she's ever wanted to do is save the world--and while a lot of people say that as a corny catchphrase, she actually means it. \nBut her dream becomes her worst nightmare when she realizes The Seven is where good intentions go to die. \nSince then, Annie has teamed up with The Boys to take down Vought and reveal Homelander's sinister aims.
711107=A former C.I.A. operative turned vigilante, Billy Butcher is as charming as he is cunning. He's a force of nature, who can talk almost anyone into anything, either through a smile or brute force - or sometimes both. He's consumed by one mission in life: to destroy superheroes and Vought. But this personal vendetta is driven by his hatred for one supe In particular: Homelander. Butcher's determined to get revenge on Homelander, no matter the cost. And he won't let anyone or anything stand in his way.
711108=Hughie is an ordinary guy with an ordinary life until one day his girlfriend is tragically killed when A-Train, the speedster on The Seven, runs through his girlfriend. Desperate for justice, Hughie's recruited by anti-"supe"vigilante Billy Butcher, and Hughie's world is turned upside down when he learns superheroes are neither super nor heroic. But that doesn't stop Hughie from falling in love with Starlight. Their romance has its ups and downs but through it all, they remain committed to one another and their fight for decency.
711109=The most powerful superhero the world has ever seen. Homelander boasts many powerful abilities, including flight, super strength, and super hearing. His x-ray vision allows him to see through nearly anything and destroy targets with his laser eyes. Homelander maintains the facade of the ultimate do-gooder, an all-American, God-fearing patriot. But the real Homelander, the one behind the movie star smile is vile, conniving, and ultimately sociopathic in his need for validation, love, and power.
711110=Sounds like Vought.
711111=Born poor on the mean streets of South Philadelphia, Soldier Boy learned the values of hard work, tenacity and bravery. He was VOUGHT's first and greatest Superhero, and was the former leader of the Superhero team Payback. But in 1984, Vought reported he died in a nuclear Power Plant meltdown. The truth of Soldier Boy's fate was not so simple. Previously, The Boys confronted Homelander at a secret Vought facility in Eden only to cause an explosion which disturbed a cryo chamber and awakening Soldier Boy from his long sleep.
711112=A member of The Seven and the fastest man in the world! But underneath the cavalier exterior of a celebrity Superhero lies the soul of a mortal athlete with a deep insecurity about staying at the top. A-Train will do whatever it takes to remain in The Seven, because he knows it's only a matter of time until a younger, faster challenger takes his place -- and that's a problem even the fastest man in the world can't outrun.
711117=Showdown with Homelander
711118=We do need your radar to continue the investigation.
711119=Event completed
711120=Here's a room. It looks like a prison cell.
711121=Anybody there? Help me!!
711122=I heard someone's voice. Who's in there?
711123=Thank goodness. Someone finally showed up! I thought I'm gonna die here alone.
711124=Who are you? And why are you here?
711125=I'm Alisa with the Minutemen. I'm held here by Zeus Group.
711126=The badge on your outfit...I saw the same one before on Natalie. Anyway, why did they lock you up here?
711127=Hmm...the lock is quite complicated. It takes at least <color=#FD5E00>4 keys</color> to open it. Alisa, any idea where to find these keys?
711128=Zeus Group usually keeps their important items in the <color=#FD5E00>Zeus Chests</color>.
711129=Given the chaotic situation, they might leave behind some of the chests.
711130=Hope you can find the keys in the remaining chests.
711131=Yep. I'll go find them.
711132=I also need to get a few more helpers. The more hands we have, the better.
711133=Keys, Zeus Chests... Ah! Now I remember!
711134=I saw several <color=#FD5E00>chests left behind by Zeus Group</color> just now. Do you think we should look into those chests?
711135="Wandering around"... Fernando, I knew you were slacking off again!
711136=Let's go have a look at the chest.
711137=...defense protocol disabled
711138=...alarm system disabled
711139=...laser scanners deactivated
711140=...the door is now open
711141=It feels so good to be free again. I don't know how to thank you guys.
711142=No worries. We gotta help each other in such an apocalyptic time.
711143=My clothes are all stained by dirt. Please allow me to change into a more decent outfit first.
711144=It's so refreshing in clean clothes. Let me introduce myself again. I'm Alisa from Minutemen.
711145=Alisa, we are trying to rebuild this fortress, but there are too many things we do not know of.
711146=I believe you know the place better. So we'd like to invite you to join us.
711147=Sure! It's my pleasure!
711148=In fact, apart from the human experiments, Zeus Group has <color=#FD5E00>a darker plan</color>. The files are stored <color=#FD5E00>somewhere inside the fortress</color>.
711149=I'll show you all the secrets of the place if you are interested.
711150=Great. Then what are we waiting for?
711151=There's a <color=#FD5E00>access card</color> inside the box. Looks like we can open one of the locks of the prison with it.

900034=Combating Illegal Transactions
900035=Dear Commander,\nRecently, there have been illegal and misleading ads on the web about third-party discounts, refunds and other illegal transactions. Here, we solemnly declare that these are all false and misleading info. Commanders must not be deceived by these illegal offers, as these offers will often result in the loss of in-game assets.\n\nTo maintain order in the wasteland, ensure the interests of Commanders and the security of account info, authorities will henceforth crack down on and punish illegal activities such as third-party transactions and trades severely, including but not limited to:\n1. Accounts that already had transactions made by a third party will have all items and currency involved in the transactions removed. If remaining items are insufficient, Diamonds will be deducted instead (amount equivalent to the items' value)\n2. Accounts with heavy use of third-party transactions will face punishments ranging from temporary bans to permanent bans.\n3. Problems arising from illegal transactions and other related situations are not eligible for compensation.\n4. If losses are incurred from using third-party transaction platform, please resort to after-sales rights protection on the third-party transaction platform\n5. If an account is stolen due to aforementioned third-party transactions, account trading and other illegal activities, the account will not be eligible for recovery.\nIn addition, to ensure the safety of each Commander's personal assets and info, we solemnly remind you that transactions through third-party platforms are not protected and extremely risky\n1. Transactions through these channels have no safety guarantee. Stolen accounts and in-game asset losses are common occurrences for players who use these third-party platforms\n2. Third-party platforms may also steal player account info, or worse, personal identifications. Such info can further cause severe consequences.\n3. Third-party platforms often have an unknown source of funds, resulting in failed transactions regularly, which also exposes players to unnecessary and unpredictable risks.\nWe are dedicated to creating high-quality games for players. We work to maintain a fair gaming environment, which includes securing each and every player's in-game assets. While constantly improving the quality of the game, we also sincerely hope players will work with us in maintaining a fair and balanced world.\n\nLast Fortress Studio

Scammers gather players by building alliances and ask to add contact information to trick players into downloading other unsecured games for profit; \n2. Ask to add offline contact information such as WeChat or QQ through various threats or lures. \n\n Deception I: add third-party contact information \n Liar tactics: how much you VX or line, I am ready to pull the group, when the siege is convenient to command \n Deception tactics tactics: friends in the alliance, good morning everyone! Have not yet added my micro (WeChat) are added, WeChat account: xxxxxxx, the name is xx, added to give you a promotion to prevent the next line is kicked not added when the robot kicked, thank you for your cooperation!!! \n\n#Response: real players will not directly so straightforwardly add everyone's third-party contact information, please commander from the source to cut off. Do not add other contact information easily after joining the alliance, after all, it is debatable whether this alliance ally has the ability to act as an ally. \n\n scam two: low price gift package temptation \n scammer tactic: add me to enjoy the lowest gift package discount, 648=480 \n\n # response: this advertising slogan single and easy to recognize, the commander needs to psychologically reject the temptation, please commanders refuse any unofficial recharge channels. Such scams are very likely to include phishing sites, which pose a direct threat to your account security. \n\n scam 3: no guarantee game recommendation \n scammer tactic: friend, are you a newbie or an expert? Come and play another super fun game with me. No need to kryptonite, take you to upgrade for free to experience the feeling of being a super player. \n\n\n\n #response: this is a common solicitation for unsecured games, ruthlessly refuse or just ignore it! The game you are tricked into playing is actually the opposite of what is promised, with poor quality and a very poor experience. \n\nThe above scams still need to be watched by all commanders, pay attention to prevention, beware of being deceived. \n\nLast Fortress Studio

900564=The day is not available for a late check-in
900565=1. During the event, you can receive the daily check-in rewards when logging into the game.\n2. If you log in but do not claim the rewards for some reason, don't worry, you can still claim them the next time you log in.\nExample: You log in from December 1st to December 5th, but do not claim any check-in rewards. On December 6th, you can collect all the rewards from December 1st to December 6th.\n3. If you forget to log in on a day, don' panic, you can spend a certain number of Diamonds to make up for the missed day.\n4. The first time you try to make up for a missed check-in, you need to pay 50 Diamonds only; in the subsequent attempts, however, you'll need to spend 50 Diamonds more than the previous time, with the amount capped at 500 Diamonds.\n5. After receiving the reward of the day, you can claim it once again by making a purchase. (the following items cannot be claimed again through making purchases: heroes, hero shards, emotes, avatar frames, fortress appearances, nameplates, etc.) \n6. By making a purchase, you can only claim the reward for the same day again; that is to say, the purchase will not grant you another reward for the day on which you log in but do not claim the reward, or the day you make up for.\n7. There are rewards for consecutive check-in for 3/7/10 days. During the event, each consecutive check-in reward can only be received once.\n8. The duration for each consecutive check-in is calculated independently. After completing 3 days of consecutive check-in, you'll start from day one for 7 days of consecutive check-in challenge. A day will still count towards the consecutive check-in days even if you do not claim the reward of that day.\nExample: You complete check-in from December 1st to 8th, but you do not claim the consecutive check-in rewards. After you claim the rewards for 3 days of consecutive check-in, you'll be considered to have checked in for 5 days in the 7-day consecutive check-in challenge.\n9. Rewards (for daily check-in + consecutive check-in) not claimed in time will be sent to your mailbox after the event ends. \n10. Please refer to the time displayed on the event pages for the actual event time.

Yeti will appear randomly in the world at 0:00, 8:00 and 16:00 every day, with each round lasting for 1 hour, please go to check in time\n3. The commander can attack the Yeti individually or launch a rally attack. The more damage you deal to it, the more points you will earn. When assembling, the points are calculated based on the total DMG of the team.\n4. The single attack damage ranking list and the historical damage ranking list only count the single attack damage of a single commander.\n5. After defeating the low-level Yeti, the attackable Yeti will level up, and so will the rewards.\n6. The undefeated Yeti will escape and come up next time.

900704=1. During the event (Dec 1st, 2023 00:00:00 - Dec 31st, 23:59:59), log into the game to start accumulating the time you stay online. For every 30 minutes of accumulated online time, you can claim a Reindeer Chest.\n2. Only when you're online can you add to the accumulated online time, which means the online time will not increase while you are offline.\n3. You can collect the Reindeer Chest up to 4 times a day. After all chests are collected, the online time of the day will cease to increase.\n4. Each time you collect a Reindeer Chest, you will gain 10 EXP. When the EXP reaches a certain level, the Reindeer will be leveled up.\n5. As the level of the Reindeer increases, the Chest level will also increase. The higher the Chest level, the better rewards you can possibly get.\n6. If a chest is available for collecting, you'll need to collect it first before starting to accumulate time for the next chest, otherwise, the accumulated time will pause at the current chest.\n7. After collecting a Chest, the accumulated time will be zeroed and the accumulation for the next chest will start from scratch.\nEXAMPLE: If you log out after 20 minutes and 05 seconds accumulated, when logging back in, the online time will keep accumulating from 20 minutes and 05 seconds.\n8. The time can be accumulated across two days, but the number of attempts for collecting Chests won't be accumulated across different days.\n9. If you fail to collect the Chest after you have reached the required online time and collect it the next day, one attempt will be reduced from the number of attempts on the day of claiming.\nEXAMPLE: Say you stay online for 30 minutes in total on December 1st and can claim 1 Reindeer Chest, but you do not collect it on that day. When you log in on Dec 2nd to collect that Chest, you will consume one attempt out of the 4 attempts of Dec 2nd.\n10. Please keep an eye on the timer for the Reindeer Chests displayed on the page in the Control Center.
900705=1. During the event, complete missions to win due rewards and points. \n2. After the event starts, missions of the day will be unlocked in order. \n3.

900706=1. During the event, use Spacetime Hero Points to draw the rewards displayed on the event page. \n2. When drawing rewards, you will earn some points based on the Spacetime Hero Points you spend. Once the points reach a certain level, you'll be able to claim progress rewards. Each progress reward can only be claimed once during the event. \n3. On the event page, you can see the odds of each reward through the "Probabilities" info. \n4. Fixed rewards are in the golden vortex, while custom rewards are in the red vortex. Fixed rewards won't change; custom rewards can be selected and refreshed by tapping "change". \n5. Changing the custom rewards will not affect the accumulation of points. The odds of each reward after the change can be viewed on the "Probabilities" page. \n6. You can enjoy a discount on your first draw. The discount is only available once during the event. Please refer to the event page for the specific event duration. \n7.

399002=Get Common Crystallites by engaging in Driftland Trial, killing zombies and city-invading zombies, or occupying neutral cities.
399003=Analyze Crystallites with the Analyzer in the Crystallite Lab to get more precious Crystallum and Crystalleus.

399102=It's alright, Fernando. By challenging ourselves, we outperform ourselves. Each trial is gonna make us stronger.
399103=I see. But what actually can we get from the challenge?
399104=Here you can see the upcoming enemies and the required Immunity.
399105=The challenge grants us loads of rewards. The challenge itself is part of the rewarding journey. Let's go for it.
399111=Whoa! Awesome! Is this a secret base or what?
399112=It's the Crystallite Lab. Let's check out those cutting-edge facilities for Crystallite studies and see what we can find.
399113=The Analyzer is obviously for Crystallite analysis, which can grant us power and energy. But first, we gotta figure out how it works.
399114=*Excited yet slightly concerned* I have to admit, the facility seems complicated even to a genius like me.
399115=I found its instructions. As the manual reads, we simply need to place Crystallites into the Analyzer and wait.
399116=The materials generated from the analysis can be used in the Gene Empowerment Center.
399121=What does this facility do? Looks even more complicated. Never seen a thing like this in my life!
399122=It's for gene empowerment. By inputting Crystallum and Crystalleus, we can activate some DNAs of heroes to empower them genetically.
399123=With specific DNAs activated, the heroes will get much more powerful in the adventure.
399124=That's incredible! Wait. A good thing comes at a good cost. What do we need to get the device runnin'?
399125=Don't worry. The cost seems high, but it's all worth it. It'll make us stronger and help with our exploration.
399126=Exactly. We can also change the direction of Genetic Engineering to enhance heroes and advance techs the way we need.
399131=Look! Here's a strange pattern. I can somehow feel a force calling upon me when looking at it.
399132=As we can see from this file, the pattern has been there for ages. It has somethin' to do with a mystic creature.
399133=As we can see from this file, the creature has somethin' to do with Crystallites, which are what we try to get from here.
399134=Crystallites?! I never thought it could be this powerful! Pff...guys, we gotta handle it, and I believe we can handle it!
399141=*Trembling voice* W-where is this place? Why did we end up here? Anythin' wrong with the dimension shuttling machine?
399142=Calm down, Fernando. Look! Some people are over there. Follow them! (Several residents gathered around a huge Crystallite)
399143=Hey, guys! Could you tell us where we are? What's goin' on here?
399144=Are you new to this place too? The world is affected by Crystallites. Zombies are gathering; cities are shrouded. We have to hide ourselves.
399145=Someone once analyzed those Crystallites and extracted some stuff that can be used to activate human genes. That's all we know so far.
399146=The cities are transforming every minute. Some places took on an entirely new look. I can't believe what I see sometimes.
399147=The cities on the periphery are all taken by zombies. Don't expect to run into a single human being there.
399148=Some cities are in lockdown with comms completely cut. No one knows what's happening inside.
399149=Some cities are shrouded by dense fog. So creepy.
399150=That's...that's definitely not normal.
399151=We can't stay here wasting any time. We gotta find a way out. It's not the time to give up yet.
399152=Yes. We can explore the place further to collect more clues and help the survivors out.

803008054=While sorting out stuff, Natalie found a letter wedged between some old clothes. \n"My dear musician, \nYou don't know how many times my soul was soothed and healed by the tunes you played. They killed the pain and took me back to the good old days when we first fell in love. Sorry for not being able to complete the journey with you. Please do stay strong. Save more poor souls with your music. That's my biggest wish and my last request for you. Don't be sad after I'm gone, my dear. \nMusic brought us together; I believe our love will turn into melodies and be passed down through time."
803008055=With Thanksgiving just around the corner, Emma volunteered to make some pumpkin pies for the feast. The fragrant pies were well-received by everyone as soon as they were taken out of the oven. \n"Oh my! Emma, THAT IS INCREDIBLY DILICIOUS!" Fernando finished a hot pie with only a few bites, as if he would miss a bite if he slowed down a bit. \n"Oh! That's true! It's sweet yet not greasy; I love the soft and smooth texture. Show me how you made this, my dear Emma!" Chef Tikka widened her eyes after taking a bite, and immediately started to ask for the recipe. \n"Good to hear that. Thanks to my family's old secret recipe, the pies turn out to be a success." Emma put away the spice jars and walked toward the warehouse. \n"Come on, Emma! Just a little hint! What exactly is the secret? How about I trade my secret cocktail recipe for your recipe? Fair trade, isn't it?" \nTikka followed Emma, their voices could be faintly heard through the warehouse's door. Emma seemed to have "surrendered" to Tikka's relentless request and told her the recipe; Tikka's loud cheers sounded from behind the door. Aww...it's another bustling and jolly Thanksgiving day.
803008056=On a field exploration, the scouting team found several chicks in an abandoned farm. \n"Look what I found here!" Fernando shouted to others. "God knows how long it's been since I had chicken last time. We can make some fried chicken, roasted chicken, crunchy chicken wings...just thinking about them makes me drool!" \n"Wait...you see that? The black marks on these chicks' wings are somewhat different from ordinary chicks; we'd better isolate them and observe them for a while." Brady made his suggestion after observing the palm-sized chicks. "The last thing I wanna hear is that they got infected... Please don't... Anyway, I’ll find someone to have a look." Fernando grabbed the chicks and dashed back to the fortress. \n"These are the 'mutant chicks' you spoke of?" Bonnie took a look at the cage and burst into laughter: "Ha-ha. They have black wings because these are turkeys!" \n"Turkeys? Meaning they are edible? Perfectly safe?" \n"Perfectly safe. Let me count the days... If raised properly, they should be ready by Thanksgiving. Wait for my good news then."
803008057=The very first "Run, Turkey! Run!" competition kicked off at the Fortress on Thanksgiving. The participants are Elena the Breeding Expert, Bonnie the Biologist, and Cara the Manor Hostess. \nThe venue was the open space in front of the Garage, where the three brought their strongest turkeys, which they had raised for six months, to the starting line. At the sound of a gunshot, the turkeys bolted in fright. \n"Hey! This way, bud! You're running the wrong way!" Bonnie shouted at her turkey that was running in the opposite direction. \n"Take a turn, turn, now!" Elena gave her direction, only to find her turkey dashing straight into a wall. \n"Good! Come here, yes! This way!" Cara sprinkled some chicken feed at the finish line to attract the turkey's attention. The turkey turned its head back and forth but eventually took off and "robbed" Fernando's pumpkin pie from the audience's seats. \n"My pumpkin pie! You pie robber!" Fernando yelled at the turkey as he chased after it. The crowd burst into laughter. What a lively day.
803008058=Recently, a thief frequented the kitchen quite often. Nibbled ingredients, missing chicken legs... Emma was determined to find the thief and teach them a lesson. \nLate at night, having prepared the ingredients she needed for the next day, she turned off the light and hid behind the door in the dark. Soon, a shadow stealthily approached the kitchen and slipped in through the crack of the door. \n"Stay put!" Emma turned on the light, only to find a black dog trying to reach for a chicken leg on the table, with a tiny puppy lying pathetically at its feet. \nRealizing it was seen, the dog protected the pup and lowered its ears in fear. \n"...Alright. Forget about it. Take it as your Thanksgiving gift," Emma said. Looking at the skinny dog, she also spared her portion of food. The dog picked up the food and disappeared into the night.\nFor the next few days, Emma, who deliberately left the kitchen later than usual, didn't see the dog again, but she found an ore with bite marks on the doormat.
803008059="N.A.T.E., Happy Thanksgiving! Here's your gift." Emma handed a red-and-white-patterned scarf to N.A.T.E. \n"A scarf...for N.A.T.E.? Robot doesn't need a scarf." N.A.T.E. held the scarf with its mechanical claws, and then froze there for a few seconds, as if something went wrong with the data analysis. \n"I know, you don't actually need a scarf. But as a member of our Fortress, you deserve a nice gift." Emma wrapped the scarf around N.A.T.E. and continued, "You don't need to keep warm, but it'll make a nice ornament." \n"Gift...?" \nLater, people noticed that N.A.T.E. changed its usual work route, seemingly to avoid dirtying the scarf during work; it even optimized its workflow for this purpose. \n"Scarf...sweet...protect..."
