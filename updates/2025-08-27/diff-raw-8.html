I'd rather die than become one of those hideous things!</div><div class="diff-line add">241179=If you get infected, I'll make it quick and painless.</div><div class="diff-line add">241180=Hmph, I don't know if I should thank you or tell you to stay away from me!</div><div class="diff-line add">241181=Don't lower guard now... Fernando, check and see a way to brighten here.</div><div class="diff-line add">241182=On it! That'll be super easy for an excellent electrician like me!</div><div class="diff-line add">241183=Ugh... Are you gonna die if you stop bragging?</div><div class="diff-line add">241184=Hmm, maybe in these cabinetsâ€¦</div><div class="diff-line add">241186=I...I just slipped, that's all. If I hadn't, I would have blasted the zombie's head clean off!</div><div class="diff-line add">241190=Look, there's a door over there.</div><div class="diff-line add">241191=And behind door number one is....</div><div class="diff-line add">241192=Learn your lesson, or you gonna pay the price sooner or later.</div><div class="diff-line add">241193=Hmph.</div><div class="diff-line add">241194=Did you push me in front just now? If I turn into a zombie, the first one I'm biting is you!</div><div class="diff-line add">241195=Heh... Turn into a zombie? Then Natalie will get to you first.</div><div class="diff-line add">241196=This body... Looks like it's been here for years.</div><div class="diff-line add">241197=What's this...an ID card?</div><div class="diff-line add">241198=Oh my God! Huh... huh...</div><div class="diff-line add">241199=......</div><div class="diff-line add">241200=No no no, wait! Don't shoot! I wasn't bitten!</div><div class="diff-line add">241201=I know.</div><div class="diff-line add">241202=You hurt?</div><div class="diff-line add">241203=I wonder if Zombies can even bite through that thick skin of his.</div><div class="diff-line add">241204=Hey! C'mon. I really mean it.</div><div class="diff-line add">241206=Wait!</div><div class="diff-line add">241207=You idiot! You could've gotten us killed!</div><div class="diff-line add">241208=S...sorry...</div><div class="diff-line add">241209=Heavens! Am I dreaming? We're inside a &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;Diner&lt;/color&gt;!</div><div class="diff-line add">241210=Looks like it's been abandoned for a quite a while.</div><div class="diff-line add">241211=What's that?</div><div class="diff-line add">241212=Hmm... these stones... perfect &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;building materials&lt;/color&gt;.</div><div class="diff-line add">241213=You're welcome, Mr. "Expert".</div><div class="diff-line add">241214=Shush!</div><div class="diff-line add">241218=Oh! That was a close one!</div><div class="diff-line add">241219=Empty...empty...this is empty...empty again...darn it!</div><div class="diff-line add">241220=Find anything?</div><div class="diff-line add">241221=Empty cans and empty bottles...what do you like to have?</div><div class="diff-line add">241222=Don't worry, there're some &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;mushrooms&lt;/color&gt; growing in the cave. We can make do with it.</div><div class="diff-line add">241223=Mushrooms! I remember seeing some Mushrooms growing in a tunnel earlier!</div><div class="diff-line add">241224=But...ever since the zombie virus started spreading, all kinds of new bacteria and fungi have started emerging. Are we really gonna risk eating these mushrooms?</div><div class="diff-line add">241225=I'll give it a try first. If I'm not frothing at the mouth after ten minutes, then we should be fine...</div><div class="diff-line add">241226=They do look like the edible kind though...I'll give them a try.</div><div class="diff-line add">241227=Are you really going to risk eating these mushrooms that we know nothing about?</div><div class="diff-line add">241228=I'll nibble a tiny bit first. If I'm not foaming by the mouth in 10 minutes...then...</div><div class="diff-line add">241229=But what if they're poisoâ€”</div><div class="diff-line add">241230=Whew! That was quite the battle...</div><div class="diff-line add">241231=Whoa! The aroma of food. I smelt it miles away.</div><div class="diff-line add">241232=No, wait!</div><div class="diff-line add">241233=Ah! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to steal... Just taste it.</div><div class="diff-line add">241234=Uh... How do you think of the taste?</div><div class="diff-line add">241235=Sorry. You know, I haven't had hot food for ages. Umm...super good!</div><div class="diff-line add">241236=Hey, anythingÂ IÂ canÂ helpÂ outÂ with? An expert will save you much efforts.</div><div class="diff-line add">241237=Come clear up the stair.</div><div class="diff-line add">241241=*Panting* Nailed...nailed it! Phew...where are we heading next?</div><div class="diff-line add">241242=Follow me.</div><div class="diff-line add">241245=(Testing)</div><div class="diff-line add">241246=Mmm, smells delicious.</div><div class="diff-line add">241253=(Testing)</div><div class="diff-line add">241257=Really? That's great!</div><div class="diff-line add">241258=Okey dokey, but to be frank, don't expect it to be delicious.</div><div class="diff-line add">241261=So, shall we go?</div><div class="diff-line add">241262=Let's move out, but stay vigilant. I might not be able to save you a second time.</div><div class="diff-line add">241263=Well, actually...umm...Iâ€”I wanted to thank you for yesterday.</div><div class="diff-line add">241264=You're welcome.</div><div class="diff-line add">241267=This is probably where drinkable water is stored. Looks quite clean and uncontaminated.</div><div class="diff-line add">241268=Fernando, head back and tell them the good news firstâ€”</div><div class="diff-line add">241269=I'mÂ onÂ it!</div><div class="diff-line add">241270=and don't forget to bring an empty bottle!</div><div class="diff-line add">241271=This is a fortress, but I donâ€™t know why the people here are gone...</div><div class="diff-line add">241272=There's nothing wrong with living underground -- just a bit too many bugs...</div><div class="diff-line add">241273=These things have to be clarified. Today I'll &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;investigate&lt;/color&gt; further down. As for you...</div><div class="diff-line add">241274=Okay, but the question is, where have all the people here gone?</div><div class="diff-line add">241275=Emma, please go find some &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;food&lt;/color&gt;, and for the safety of the &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;door&lt;/color&gt;... Natalie, can you take charge?</div><div class="diff-line add">241276=No problem.</div><div class="diff-line add">241277=!!! The ground is shaking... Was there an earthquake?</div><div class="diff-line add">241278=Need to keep an eye on the roof terrace.</div><div class="diff-line add">241279=However, we'll have to clear away these debris first.</div><div class="diff-line add">241280=Fine, anyway, this is the only choice.</div><div class="diff-line add">241281=Trust me, everything will be fine.</div><div class="diff-line add">241282=Done! Smells good, but I can't assure you whether it's safe to eat.</div><div class="diff-line add">241283=This is not a poisonous mushroom. if you don't trust, I can taste it first.</div><div class="diff-line add">241284=Wait! Brady!</div><div class="diff-line add">241285=Just joking. Don't be that serious.</div><div class="diff-line add">241286=Don't worry, I know it very well.</div><div class="diff-line add">241287=If I see you sneaking food again, I swear I'll throw you out to feed the zombies.</div><div class="diff-line add">241288=Wow, I heard that right, right? Emma would actually say thank you!</div><div class="diff-line add">241289=Alright, buds... Let's call it a day. Time to have dinner.</div><div class="diff-line add">241290=Could you prepare and cook the mushrooms?</div><div class="diff-line add">241300=Get out of the way! We gotta do this.</div><div class="diff-line add">241312=Wait!</div><div class="diff-line add">241326=No... Zombies are bitting the door! Do something!</div><div class="diff-line add">241327=Calm down! We're safe now.</div><div class="diff-line add">241328=Emma, you okay?</div><div class="diff-line add">241329=Stop!</div><div class="diff-line add">241330=Out of the way! You will get everyone killed!</div><div class="diff-line add">241331=If you are infected, I'll make it quick and painless.</div><div class="diff-line add">241332=Don't lower guard now... Fernando, check and see a way to brighten here.</div><div class="diff-line add">241333=Look, I found the light switch!</div><div class="diff-line add">241334=Erm, sorry... I just got a bit excited.</div><div class="diff-line add">241335=Look.</div><div class="diff-line add">241336=Geez...is that a zombie tidal wave?!!</div><div class="diff-line add">241337=NO! I WASN'T BITTEN AT ALL! I WASN'T!</div><div class="diff-line add">241338=Calm down everybody! Let's figure out what happened first.</div><div class="diff-line add">241339=How do you think of the taste?</div><div class="diff-line add">241340=Fernando! You ate up almost EVERYTHING!</div><div class="diff-line add">241341=No! The zombies are still biting the door! Think of a way!</div><div class="diff-line add">241342=Can I rest for a couple of minutes now? I'm dead tired.</div><div class="diff-line add">241343=Not now. We gotta check over the place first. Stay alert!</div><div class="diff-line add">241344=Don't lower guard now...</div><div class="diff-line add">242018=Natalie seems to give the cold shoulder to everyone. You think she resents us?</div><div class="diff-line add">242019=Everyone has their own demons and secrets. She already considers us as companions...can't ask for much more really.</div><div class="diff-line add">242020=I wanna be awesome like herâ€”fearless and daringâ€”no matter the odds.</div><div class="diff-line add">242021=Careful! We got movement!</div><div class="diff-line add">242022=Geez! I saw a pig coming out of it!</div><div class="diff-line add">242023=Relax, dude. It was only a &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;Gopher&lt;/color&gt;. It's kinda chubby though.</div><div class="diff-line add">242024=This Warehouse is a bit dated, looks like I'm gonna have to renovate it.</div><div class="diff-line add">242025=So, I got good news and bad news. Which first?</div><div class="diff-line add">242026=What an original opening. Whatever, let's just start with the bad! Let's see how bad things can really go.</div><div class="diff-line add">242027=Well it's quite bad! We don't have enough food!</div><div class="diff-line add">242028=Please tell me you're joking.</div><div class="diff-line add">242029=Maybe we can venture back to the surface and scavenge for some food?</div><div class="diff-line add">242030=I think you're more likely to become food than to find food.</div><div class="diff-line add">242031=Yikes...well what's the good news?</div><div class="diff-line add">242032=We discovered a ton of gophers in the Fortress, a couple of pounds each by the looks of it.</div><div class="diff-line add">242033=Nope! Heck no. I'd...I'd rather not eat! No way! Let me fight some zombies instead!</div><div class="diff-line add">242034=I heard gopher meat is actually quite tasty. Either way, it's better than starving.</div><div class="diff-line add">242035=You...you're all agreeing on this?</div><div class="diff-line add">242036=I'm down to try some.</div><div class="diff-line add">242038=No complaints here.</div><div class="diff-line add">242039=Then it's decided!</div><div class="diff-line add">242049=Could this be...</div><div class="diff-line add">242050=It's the Control Center!</div><div class="diff-line add">242051=Basically, it's the "brains" of the entire Fortress.</div><div class="diff-line add">242052=That sounds quite fancy, but this door doesn't seem to want to open.</div><div class="diff-line add">242053=Looks like it's a sliding door... Here's the card reader...</div><div class="diff-line add">242054=Maybe we can use that ID card we found yesterday.</div><div class="diff-line add">242055=Didn't expect there to be a place like this in the Fortress!</div><div class="diff-line add">242056=You think they still work?</div><div class="diff-line add">242058=Backup power supply is functional...cables are all connected...there! I'm entering the system!</div><div class="diff-line add">242059=Ah...but now I need the password...</div><div class="diff-line add">242060=Wait, I remember seeing a line of random numbers and letters in that dusty notebook. Argh, what were those numbers...</div><div class="diff-line add">242061=326IM30LCYD. Access Granted.</div><div class="diff-line add">242062=Awesome!</div><div class="diff-line add">242065=Don'tÂ move.Â It'sÂ anÂ IDÂ logger.</div><div class="diff-line add">242067=Great! Now we have clearance for some new facilities!</div><div class="diff-line add">242070=Son of a gun! The screen died! These devices are way too dated to be used properly!</div><div class="diff-line add">242071=Dated parts? Hmm...</div><div class="diff-line add">242072=What are you doing!? You're going to break it beyond repair!</div><div class="diff-line add">242073=Second Work Station opened!</div><div class="diff-line add">242074=Aha! I used the same trick to fix my old radio back home!</div><div class="diff-line add">242075=You're amazing Fernando! Now we've got an additional Work Station!</div><div class="diff-line add">242076=But you can't always rely on your brute force! We should upgrade the Control Center as soon as possible.</div><div class="diff-line add">242077=Hey, what'd you find?</div><div class="diff-line add">242078=Oh! The great big guy is afraid of rats! Hahaha! Don't worry buddy, I'll keep your secret to myself!</div><div class="diff-line add">242079=Heavens my! They're both terrifying! I'm gonna go crazy!</div><div class="diff-line add">242080=Great news everyone! We've found the most vital location of this place!</div><div class="diff-line add">242081=The food storage room? Ready the champagne and steak! We partying today!</div><div class="diff-line add">242082=Well, of course! Each additional day survived is worth celebrating for a fool like you.</div><div class="diff-line add">242087=This is the Control Center, the core facility of this underground fortress. Now, let me see how we can get inside...</div><div class="diff-line add">242088=Try the ID card we found earlier.</div><div class="diff-line add">242089=Woo, that's awesome!</div><div class="diff-line add">242090=Don't go pushing any buttons!</div><div class="diff-line add">242091=No fair! Look at Natalieâ€”</div><div class="diff-line add">242092=Backup power supply is operating normally... The damage seems to be minor.</div><div class="diff-line add">242093=Who the hell are you?</div><div class="diff-line add">242094=...I have to say, I got my secrets, but I'm not your enemy!</div><div class="diff-line add">242095=Fine, a new &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;Work Station&lt;/color&gt; unlocked...</div><div class="diff-line add">242096=New&lt;color=#E5131B&gt; Work Station&lt;/color&gt; ? Well, not bad, Fernando got a job now.</div><div class="diff-line add">242097=Looks like you got your work cut out for you. Grab a shovel and get going, Mr. Expert-at-everything!</div><div class="diff-line add">242098=Huh?</div><div class="diff-line add">242099=Looks like we are favored by luck! Gophers can make a great dish these days!</div><div class="diff-line add">242100=We'll need a &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;ladder&lt;/color&gt; to get down here.</div><div class="diff-line add">242101=It should be able to start up normally.</div><div class="diff-line add">242102=No joke, those rats were as fat as piglets! I was almost knocked over and trampled by them!</div><div class="diff-line add">242104=Don't you see? Their existence means we have food now!</div><div class="diff-line add">242105=Hold up, lemme clean my ears...did you say, EAT THE RATS??</div><div class="diff-line add">242106=The alternative is eating Mushrooms for the rest of your life.</div><div class="diff-line add">242107=Uh...hmm...fair point. But catching those slippery rodents won't be easy...</div><div class="diff-line add">242108=That's where you come into play, Mr. Expert Hunter!</div><div class="diff-line add">242109=The diary indicates that this fortress was much larger in the past.</div><div class="diff-line add">242110=That means, there're much more mysteries awaiting us to explore.</div><div class="diff-line add">242111=Just like a candy house?</div><div class="diff-line add">242112=Hope there is equipment that can help us return to the ground.</div><div class="diff-line add">242113=Come on, mate! Without further ado, let's do something now!</div><div class="diff-line add">242114=Wow! Hard to believe. This is even messier than the place where I've lived.</div><div class="diff-line add">242115=Looks like it's a &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;Warehouse&lt;/color&gt;. Check out these boxes. See if there's something we need.</div><div class="diff-line add">242116=With these stones, we would be able to build more rooms.</div><div class="diff-line add">242117=There must be some kind of facilities that will consuming this large amount of coal, like Power Generator.</div><div class="diff-line add">242118=The warehouse is so well-organized that it can accomodate more materials.</div><div class="diff-line add">242119=I hope your inventory list does not contain gophers.</div><div class="diff-line add">242120=Gophers? You are right. Gophers should be of some use elsewhere.</div><div class="diff-line add">242121=Did you say, EAT THE RATS??</div><div class="diff-line add">242122=Trust me. The taste of Gopher will never let you down.</div><div class="diff-line add">242123=Woo. My mouth is already watering. Let's try some. Why wait?</div><div class="diff-line add">242124=I'll leave it all to you. I feel sick at the mere thought of it.</div><div class="diff-line add">242125=Aha, wait for the delicacy then.</div><div class="diff-line add">242126=This should be the &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;Control Center&lt;/color&gt;, the core of the entire underground facility.</div><div class="diff-line add">242127=&lt;color=#E5131B&gt;Control Center&lt;/color&gt;? But how to get in?</div><div class="diff-line add">242128=Look out! Zoombies!</div><div class="diff-line add">242129=Hope the facility still works.</div><div class="diff-line add">242130=The repair of the Control Center was finished, and another area was unlocked.</div><div class="diff-line add">242131=Hope that's not a waste of our time.</div><div class="diff-line add">242132=Got it! a brand new area has now opened to us.</div><div class="diff-line add">242133=As the level of the Control Center goes up, it seems that we can access more areas.</div><div class="diff-line add">242134=Be careful, it doesn't feel right here.</div><div class="diff-line add">242135=Don't try to fool me! I can tell when you're lying.</div><div class="diff-line add">242136=Okay, I trust you, but I hope you could tell us your story someday.</div><div class="diff-line add">242137=If what the diary says is correct, the Control Center should be right behind the door.</div><div class="diff-line add">242138=Now the issue is how to get it open. Emm...lemme see if we missed something...</div><div class="diff-line add">242141=The card.</div><div class="diff-line add">242142=Yep! The card we found earlier! Why didn't I think of that!</div><div class="diff-line add">242144=Look! What's that...?</div><div class="diff-line add">242146=Woo, awesome! You're really "Natalie of all trades"!</div><div class="diff-line add">242147=... A &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;Work Station&lt;/color&gt; was unlocked on our upper right side.</div><div class="diff-line add">242148=A &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;Work Station&lt;/color&gt;? Ask Fernando to go up and have a look. Emma, go check it out with Fernando.</div><div class="diff-line add">242149=Okey dokey!</div><div class="diff-line add">242150=It doesn't matter... Anyway, I ain't your enemy.</div><div class="diff-line add">242151=Then lemme put it this way: how much do you know about the place?</div><div class="diff-line add">242152=We gotta &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;have the Control Center fixed&lt;/color&gt;, for all other functions are under its control.</div><div class="diff-line add">242153=The diary said the place was a giant structure. But the thing is, it seems to be quite the opposite.</div><div class="diff-line add">242154=That's not hard to explain. Cuz what we see right now is no more than the tip of an iceberg. Something must have happened here.</div><div class="diff-line add">242155=So...what we gonna do?</div><div class="diff-line add">242156=Keep going. I got a hunch some stunning secrets are still out there awaiting us.</div><div class="diff-line add">242157=The diary says there're many &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;facilities&lt;/color&gt; and &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;supplies&lt;/color&gt; down here. So the goal today is to find them. Let's move!</div><div class="diff-line add">242158=Why you seem to be so familiar with the place?</div><div class="diff-line add">243001=Guys, we're running out of water! The water left will hold out for two more days at most...</div><div class="diff-line add">243002=I think I saw a water stain on the right side corner of the Control Center. There must be a water source nearby.</div><div class="diff-line add">243003=Well, what're we waiting for? Let's get crackalackin'!</div><div class="diff-line add">243008=Oh thank goodness, I'm still breathing! Thank you, thank you all!</div><div class="diff-line add">243009=Halt! Arms up, and don't even think about making any sudden movements!</div><div class="diff-line add">243011=No, please, we're not infected! We don't have any weapons either!</div><div class="diff-line add">243012=Check 'em</div><div class="diff-line add">243013=All's good. They're perfectly normal.</div><div class="diff-line add">243014=Sorry friends, gotta be extra careful nowadays, right?</div><div class="diff-line add">243015=Of course. Our group was scavenging for food in a supermarket when zombies rushed out from the warehouse...</div><div class="diff-line add">243016=Don't worry, you guys are safe now. We have plenty of space in our Fortress for you guys to stay in.</div><div class="diff-line add">243017=I can't thank you enough! But...my friends might still be alive. Can you consider rescuing them? Please, they're the only family I have left...</div><div class="diff-line add">243018=Where are they?</div><div class="diff-line add">243019=To the southwest, about 3 to 4 kilometers from here.</div><div class="diff-line add">243020=That's way too far. We'll never make it there alive.</div><div class="diff-line add">243021=Please, I beg you! They're all capable people with different skillsets, like me! I'm an electrician! There must be a way to save them!</div><div class="diff-line add">243022=Well, maybe there is a way...</div><div class="diff-line add">243023=Help, anyone!</div><div class="diff-line add">243024=Break time's over buddy. Take another trip with us.</div><div class="diff-line add">243025=SIR FERNANDO! Please stop shaking the table!</div><div class="diff-line add">243026=What the hell are you talking about? I didn't move an inch.</div><div class="diff-line add">243027=You didn't? Then why is the hell shaking?</div><div class="diff-line add">243028=Zombie Tidal?!</div><div class="diff-line add">243029=Thank god! We're safe! Thank you for y...</div><div class="diff-line add">243030=Freeze!</div><div class="diff-line add">243031=Wait! Wait! Hold on, Madam! We ain't gonna hurt you.</div><div class="diff-line add">243032=Then stay put. I gotta make sure youâ€™re not infected.</div><div class="diff-line add">243033=I'll leave it to you.</div><div class="diff-line add">243034=Sorry guys. You know, in a world like this, we gotta be extra careful.</div><div class="diff-line add">243035=Itâ€™s okay. The city we came from was sieged. Hard to describe how we make it here.</div><div class="diff-line add">243036=Heh, stop it. Because you're lucky enough to have me, your lifesaver.</div><div class="diff-line add">243037=Perhaps you're right. But some of our friends are still stuck on the way here.</div><div class="diff-line add">243038=Forget about those suckers. They're doomed anyway.</div><div class="diff-line add">243039=You...you bastard! You just promised we would go back to save them.</div><div class="diff-line add">243040=Innocent boy! You'll also get killed if you get out again!</div><div class="diff-line add">243041=Listen, my friend. First tell me where your friends are?</div><div class="diff-line add">243042=They're in an abandoned supermarket in the southwest. Only 5 miles from here.</div><div class="diff-line add">243043=Don't be sillyâ€¦there're zombies everywhere, and we'll get killed before we walk there.</div><div class="diff-line add">243044=Walking is certainly not an option. But there might be another way worth trying.</div><div class="diff-line add">243045=Hey dudes, you found something new?</div><div class="diff-line add">243046=An abandoned &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;Mine&lt;/color&gt;, right below the Control Center.</div><div class="diff-line add">243047=There's not much of it, but they're enough to let us hold for some time.</div><div class="diff-line add">243048=A &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;mine&lt;/color&gt;? Not bad. May be of some use.</div><div class="diff-line add">243049=I am an expert in cleaning the Mine, but there seems to be some sound inside...</div><div class="diff-line add">243050=Ahhhhhhh! Something is moving! ...Help!</div><div class="diff-line add">243051=Finally, it's done. I hate clearing Zombies.</div><div class="diff-line add">243052=Do you want to check again? I feel sick just thinking of their faces!</div><div class="diff-line add">243053=No need, I've done that.</div><div class="diff-line add">243054=Let's go back and let them know.</div><div class="diff-line add">243055=Speaking of vehicles...maybe I can help.</div><div class="diff-line add">243056=It's all blocked. We gotta break those &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;blocks&lt;/color&gt;.</div><div class="diff-line add">243057=The water here looks quite clean and uncontaminated. Our hard work finally pays.</div><div class="diff-line add">243058=Woo. Look. An artificial Cistern!</div><div class="diff-line add">243059=I think it was built by former Residents. Anyway, we don't need to worry about Water for a short time.</div><div class="diff-line add">243060=Wrap it on me, I'm a water transport expert!</div><div class="diff-line add">243061=...and don't forget to bring an empty bottle!</div><div class="diff-line add">243062=Thank you.</div><div class="diff-line add">243063=Could you give me more?</div><div class="diff-line add">243064=Finally, we got the meal.</div><div class="diff-line add">243065=Compared to the world outside, this place is practically a paradise.</div><div class="diff-line add">243066=We will have more chances if the jeep can be fixed.</div><div class="diff-line add">243067=Oh, man, it's downright broken. You know what? I was a car mechanic. I'll see what I can do.</div><div class="diff-line add">243068=It just looks a little bit broken, but it should still work. Dude, let's fix it!</div><div class="diff-line add">243069=Phew... The overall check-up was done. The old buddy is ready to go!</div><div class="diff-line add">243070=Woo. Hard to believe. My old buddy is good as new.</div><div class="diff-line add">244001=At last, we finally found the Fortress' Power Generator...</div><div class="diff-line add">244002=As long as the main power generator here is active, there'll be no need to rely on that poor emergency generator.</div><div class="diff-line add">244003=What needs to be done then?</div><div class="diff-line add">244004=The Coal we found in the Material Warehouse can be used here.</div><div class="diff-line add">244005=Let's get to it then!</div><div class="diff-line add">244006=We can consume &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;Power&lt;/color&gt; and &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;Scientific Components&lt;/color&gt; to research various technologies. Let's just start with &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;Mechatronics&lt;/color&gt;.</div><div class="diff-line add">244007=Great! With &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;Mechatronics&lt;/color&gt;, those &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;Sandstone (Lv.2)&lt;/color&gt; won't be a problem for us ever again!</div><div class="diff-line add">244008=I don't think such a heavily reinforced door was constructed to protect some boxes.</div><div class="diff-line add">244009=I discovered all the wires in the Fortress extend in this direction.</div><div class="diff-line add">244010=Seems we found where the Power Generator is then!</div><div class="diff-line add">244011=Check it out. There's a giant box behind the giant door left of the Control Center.</div><div class="diff-line add">244012=I bet there's some magnificent treasure in there!</div><div class="diff-line add">244013=Now we just need to find a way to open the door!</div><div class="diff-line add">244014=Did you guys notice the Laboratory above the Power Generator?</div><div class="diff-line add">244015=Of course! It can function normally now that it has power!</div><div class="diff-line add">244016=Laboratory? Is that where technology is researched? That's so cool! So, what are we researching first?</div><div class="diff-line add">244017=Mechatronics! We'll be able to deal with that pesky &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;Sandstone (Lv. 2)&lt;/color&gt; once we master that technology!</div><div class="diff-line add">244018=Friends! It's about time for an overall improvement in our home! I propose we upgrade the Laboratory to Lv. 2 first.</div><div class="diff-line add">244019=The reason being?</div><div class="diff-line add">244020=Once we upgrade the Laboratory, we can research even more technologies, such as one that makes catching gophers easy as pie!</div><div class="diff-line add">244021=Ready, mate? We're about to begin construction now!</div><div class="diff-line add">244022=But first, these Density &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;Sandstone (Lv.2) &lt;/color&gt; need to be cleared away.</div><div class="diff-line add">244023=Time to show 'em the power of "Mechatronics"!</div><div class="diff-line add">244024=Commander, where's the "something something easy as pie" technology you promised?</div><div class="diff-line add">244025=In the Laboratory! What was that technology called?</div><div class="diff-line add">244026="Gopher Wheel".</div><div class="diff-line add">244027=Is this room empty? So what was that noise just now?</div><div class="diff-line add">244028=It could be a gopher... I'd better check it first and make sure it's safe before you come in.</div><div class="diff-line add">244029=Ehâ€¦.thatâ€¦.I'm having a slight stomache now. Wait for a second, please!</div><div class="diff-line add">244030=Circuit board, gearsâ€¦now we can make some ice creamsï¼ŸWooâ€¦That's so exciting!</div><div class="diff-line add">244031=Noâ€¦ more important job is we have to research the &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;Mechatronics&lt;/color&gt;.</div><div class="diff-line add">244032=Mechâ€¦.mechatronics? What's the use? I prefer to have some ice cream.</div><div class="diff-line add">244033=&lt;color=#E5131B&gt;Mechatronics&lt;/color&gt; can allow us to break those hard &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;Sandstones (Lv.2)&lt;/color&gt;, so we could expand the Fortress.</div><div class="diff-line add">244034=Are these culture tanks for cloning technology? ! How many secrets are still hidden here...</div><div class="diff-line add">244037=Rome was not built in a day. At the moment, we need to research Mechatronics with technological components and electrical devices.</div><div class="diff-line add">244038=Did it work? Natalie, let's see what we can get this time.</div><div class="diff-line add">244039=Patience, boy! Sometimes things are not what they look like.</div><div class="diff-line add">244040=&lt;color=#E5131B&gt;Power generator&lt;/color&gt;? That's great! The Fortress has Power Facilities now.</div><div class="diff-line add">244041=Woo! So that means we could have airconditioning now. That's cool! Let's take a look!</div><div class="diff-line add">244042=Careful! We got movement!</div><div class="diff-line add">244043=Damn it, can't these things lie down all the time!</div><div class="diff-line add">244044=I've finished checking now, and there's no fuel left inside the generator.</div><div class="diff-line add">244045=Fuel is not a problem, there is some Coal available in the Warehouse.</div><div class="diff-line add">244046=Aâ€¦box? Are you serious? That's so disappointing!</div><div class="diff-line add">244047=The Power Generator is operating normally! Need any other help, bud?</div><div class="diff-line add">244048=Hmm... Just now at the Power Generator, I heard strange footsteps upstairs. It's like something's running around...</div><div class="diff-line add">244049=Don't worry. I'll go up to check it.</div><div class="diff-line add">244050=What? It's done...</div><div class="diff-line add">244051=...Fernando, remember my advice... Recklessness will hurt everyone someday.</div><div class="diff-line add">244052=S-sorry... Uh, a room upstairs is open, let's go take a look.</div><div class="diff-line add">244053=Are you still planning to rescue the survivors today? Our rooms are almost out of place!</div><div class="diff-line add">244054=I tried to expand... but all the Blocks are hard &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;Sandstones (Lv.2)&lt;/color&gt;, which cannot be excavated with a shovel.</div><div class="diff-line add">244055=So, we can only watch more and more people coming and crowding together?</div><div class="diff-line add">244056=Let me see... The diary states that the original scale was much larger than the current one, and there must be tools that can dig the &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;sandstone (Lv.2)&lt;/color&gt;.</div><div class="diff-line add">244057=You are right.</div><div class="diff-line add">244058=I just found a way to upgrade the Control Center. If it succeeds, it should be able to solve the problem of Block Excavation.</div><div class="diff-line add">244059=This is already the third time! It seems that it is receiving signals but cannot be connected. Is this device broken or not?</div><div class="diff-line add">244060=I have checked it out, and the problem is not on the device.</div><div class="diff-line add">244061=That's weird, ha, let this expert check it again!</div><div class="diff-line add">244062=Hmm... I seem to have seen the pattern above before... Yes, the Control Center!</div><div class="diff-line add">244063=Control Center? Maybe it has something to do with its Level.</div><div class="diff-line add">244064=Wow!!! What was that just now? Zombies that can generate power?</div><div class="diff-line add">244065=Maybe it's just a gopher, I'll check it out first.</div><div class="diff-line add">244066=Security question - just leave it to me!</div><div class="diff-line add">244067=Phuuu... Do we really have to expand? The soil here is harder than the diamond!</div><div class="diff-line add">244068=Harder than diamonds? You are really an expert in finding excuses.</div><div class="diff-line add">244069=He's not finding excuses. The soil is mixed with &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;sandstones (Lv. 2)&lt;/color&gt;. Not a chance to dig it with a bare shovel.</div><div class="diff-line add">244070=So what? People are getting more and more. Are we gonna fit all the people in this space and have nightmares face to face?</div><div class="diff-line add">244071=It's gonna work! Remember what is said in the diary? It used to be much bigger than it is now.</div><div class="diff-line add">244072=Bigger than now... So what? Can you turn back time?</div><div class="diff-line add">244073=Hey, ease. I mean there should be some tools for excavation. We just haven't found them yet.</div><div class="diff-line add">244074=I'll go check the Control Center again. Hope I can figure out how to break &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;sandstones (Lv. 2)&lt;/color&gt;.</div><div class="diff-line add">244075=Come on in. The room's clear.</div><div class="diff-line add">244076=Circuit board, gears...</div><div class="diff-line add">244077=Woo, this is a Laboratory!</div><div class="diff-line add">244078=Try to use these components to assemble tools like drills.</div><div class="diff-line add">244079=If we can make it, we'll be able to crack those hard &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;sandstones (Lv. 2)&lt;/color&gt;!</div><div class="diff-line add">244080=The upgrade was done. The Gate to the &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;Power Generator&lt;/color&gt; is open!</div><div class="diff-line add">244081=This is the Power Generator? Do you hear the sound from behind the door?</div><div class="diff-line add">244082=...That's from zombies. Sounds like there're a number of them.</div><div class="diff-line add">244083=Then go get someone! Do you wanna fight with them like this? Just we two alone?</div><div class="diff-line add">244084=Or what?</div><div class="diff-line add">244085=Ouch, it hurts my arm!</div><div class="diff-line add">244086=Stop, the earth is much harder than it used to be, and it's useless to dig down this way.</div><div class="diff-line add">244087=Then I have to take a rest first ---- Don't be lazy!</div><div class="diff-line add">244088=Picks are only fit for excavating some &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;Clays (Lv.1)&lt;/color&gt;. For &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;Sandstones (Lv.2)&lt;/color&gt;, we need some tougher tools.</div><div class="diff-line add">244089=Not a single lump of coal in the generator? Phhhh...such a boomer thing.</div><div class="diff-line add">244090=Go check the &lt;color=#E5131B&gt;Warehouse&lt;/color&gt;. You'll find some there.</div><div class="diff-line add">244091=It's locked from the inside. Let's go get some tools?</div><div class="diff-line add">244092=Why bother?</div><div class="diff-line add">244093=Wait, you mean...</div><div class="diff-line add">244094=Please! Give me a notice next time! Almost scared the shit out of me.</div><div class="diff-line add">244095=Now shut up and get ready.</div><div class="diff-line add">244096=What's goin' on? The power is out? My soup's spilled all over the floor.</div><div class="diff-line add">244097=Ouch. I slipped just now. I can still feel the dull pain in my butt.</div><div class="diff-line add">244098=It's the problem with the backup power supply -- the power's running low.</div><div class="diff-line add">244099=Oh, no. It sucks. What we gonna do?</div><div class="diff-line add">244100=Not a big deal. There's gotta be another power supply.</div><div class="diff-line add">244101=Power supply? Any idea where it could be?</div><div class="diff-line add">244102=Hmm... What do you think, Natalie?</div><div class="diff-line add">244103=I think the answer would be the Control Center.</div><div class="diff-line add">244104=Boss, the generator is ready.</div><div class="diff-line add">244105=Good. Now let's see whether we got it right.</div><div class="diff-line add">244106=Fernando, turn off the backup power.</div><div class="diff-line add">244107=Copy that! I'll switch it off in 3, 2, 1...</div><div class="diff-line add">244108=Aha! Boss, we made it!</div><div class="diff-line add">244109=Good job! The power is quite sufficient. Could save us a lot of trouble.</div><div class="diff-line add">244110=Hey, Brady!</div><div class="diff-line add">244111=Look! There's a room over there.</div><div class="diff-line add">244112=Room cleared. Come in.</div><div class="diff-line add">244113=Circuit boards, gears... Geez, what a mess.</div><div class="diff-line add">244114=What kinda place is this? A lab?</div><div class="diff-line add">244115=I guess the table already told us the answer.</div><div class="diff-line add">244116=These're...some designs?</div><div class="diff-line add">244117=Yep. With them, we could try to make some tools.</div><div class="diff-line add">244130=Look! Here's a way to somewhere below.</div><div class="diff-line add">244131=Hold on a sec! Tell others to come here. I'll stay here for now.</div><div class="diff-line add">244132=Geez. We got us in a huge trouble!</div><div class="diff-line add">244133=Shhh! Chubby guy. You gonna attract 'em all here.</div><div class="diff-line add">244134=Take it easy. We can handle these couple of Zombies.</div><div class="diff-line add">244135=Natalie, now it's our turn.</div><div class="diff-line add">244136=The next destination - ticket office.</div><div class="diff-line add">244137=Watch out! There're a few more down the stairs.</div><div class="diff-line add">244138=What we gonna do? it's pitch dark down there!</div><div class="diff-line add">244139=We gotta look for a torch or somethin' before getting down.</div><div class="diff-line add">244140=Perhaps...we can check the electricity in the switch room.</div><div class="diff-line add">244141=Good idea. Let's go.</div><div class="diff-line add">244142=Booyah!</div><div class="diff-line add">244143=Help! H.E.L.P.!</div><div class="diff-line add">244144=Freeze!</div><div class="diff-line add">244145=Don't shoot! I'm not infected. And I can help!</div><div class="diff-line add">244146=Get over!</div><div class="diff-line add">244147=...That's basically what happened so far. Hordes of Zombies are comin' this way! For real! We gotta do somethin' before it's too late.</div><div class="diff-line add">244148=With all that's being said, got any plan, dude?</div><div class="diff-line add">244149=See the room over there?</div><div class="diff-line add">244150=The control room of the metro?</div><div class="diff-line add">244151=Yep. It's occupied by Zombies. If we can take it back, we still stand a chance to bump those things away with the metro.</div><div class="diff-line add">244152=Sounds it's worth a try. Let's go get it.</div><div class="diff-line add">244153=Metro system activated.</div><div class="diff-line add">244154=What's goin' on?</div><div class="diff-line add">244155=Let's check it out. Stay alert!</div><div class="diff-line add">244156=Lookâ€”</div><div class="diff-line add">244157=Damn! There's no way to get into the metro with the big fella standing in the way!</div><div class="diff-line add">244158=Then get rid of him. We're running out of time. Follow me!</div><div class="diff-line add">244159=Who's there? Come out!</div><div class="diff-line add">244160=How's it going? Can you start it?</div><div class="diff-line add">244161=Getting ready! Everybody, stand firm!</div><div class="diff-line add">245001=Is this...another Control Center?</div><div class="diff-line add">245002=Doesn't look like it, it's quite different from the previous Control Center.</div><div class="diff-line add">245004=Is there any way to reboot it?</div><div class="diff-line add">245005=They might be covered in layers of dust, but the devices are still in decent shape. Shouldn't be a problem for me!</div><div class="diff-line add">245016=Woo! The screen is on! Look, it's really a satellite screen!</div><div class="diff-line add">245017=Do these red dots indicate survivors? Why are some signals strong and some weak?</div><div class="diff-line add">245018=The signal strength represents the CP - The stronger the signal, the higher the chance of survival.</div><div class="diff-line add">245019=So, can these survivors be contacted by satellite?</div><div class="diff-line add">245020=Not a big deal. We can give it a try.</div><div class="diff-line add">245021=Contact those with a high chance of survival first. If successful, we are able to recruit reliable fighters!</div><div class="diff-line add">245022=WelcomeÂ friend.</div><div class="diff-line add">245023=This place is amazing! How did you guys manage to find this place?</div><div class="diff-line add">245024=It was nothing really, we're just the beneficiaries of this Fortress.</div><div class="diff-line add">245025=But let's talk about you.</div><div class="diff-line add">245026=Me? ...Not much to talk about really, I just focus on gathering resources and surviving!</div><div class="diff-line add">245027=Resources? Are there still lots of resources outside?</div><div class="diff-line add">245028=You bet! There's a large abandoned industrial area near here that's practically full of treasure, so to speak.</div><div class="diff-line add">245029=There are lots of zombies in that area as well. Exterminate them first, and you'll be able to gather resources in relative peace!</div><div class="diff-line add">245030=Ugh...those ugly things again...</div><div class="diff-line add">245031=Hate them all you want, but don't forget, zombies have all sorts of items on them. In a sense, they're a source for "resources" as well!</div><div class="diff-line add">245032=Some extremely repulsive resources...</div><div class="diff-line add">245033=More survivors are joining our Fortress. Soon we won't be able to rely solely on the resources within the Fortress.</div><div class="diff-line add">245034=Plus, certain resources can't be found underground.</div><div class="diff-line add">245035=Perhaps it's time for us to return to the surface!</div><div class="diff-line add">245036=Are you willing to lead the way Akendalf?</div><div class="diff-line add">245037=I'm yours to command!</div><div class="diff-line add">245038=I found some thick wires to the right of the Control Center.</div><div class="diff-line add">245039=They're called "communication cables".</div><div class="diff-line add">245040=Communication cables? Does that mean...? No way!</div><div class="diff-line add">245041=Nothing's impossible. Let's continue exploring!</div><div class="diff-line add">245042=Huh? What's with the competition?</div><div class="diff-line add">245043=Don't you know? These zombies are my "Exclusive Resources"?</div><div class="diff-line add">245044=Stop pretending. You were already here!</div><div class="diff-line add">245045=...</div><div class="diff-line add">245046=You...you must be blind!</div><div class="diff-line add">245047=Whatever you say, chief...we don't mind an extra member; there are enough zombies here to go around!</div><div class="diff-line add">245048=Does that count as an invitation? If so, then I accept!</div><div class="diff-line add">245049=We rescued an excavation expert!</div><div class="diff-line add">245050=Excuse me. I'm actually a geologist.</div><div class="diff-line add">245051=Okay, the great geologist. We now need your help in those mines.</div><div class="diff-line add">245052=Just let her distinguish herself at the Stone Quarry!</div><div class="diff-line add">245053=I've figured it out! The rooftop facility with the helicopter is actually a trading post!</div><div class="diff-line add">245054=Butter my butt and call me a biscuit! There are still people doing business out there?</div><div class="diff-line add">245055=That's human nature for you. As long as there's profit to be made, there'll be humans!</div><div class="diff-line add">245056=What I meant to say is, we can consider it when the need arises.</div><div class="diff-line add">245057=Based on its power usage instructions, activating it requires ample amounts of Power</div><div class="diff-line add">245058=Try it out now</div><div class="diff-line add">245059=Guys, thanks for taking me in! To be honest, I haven't killed enough zombies yet, but I do need a safe environment to rest.</div><div class="diff-line add">245060=It sounds like you are good at fighting and dare to hunt zombies?</div><div class="diff-line add">245061=Dare to hunt zombies? No, to be precise, it's a kind of enjoyment! This is my greatest pleasure.</div><div class="diff-line add">245062=I found a lot of supplies in the warehouses along the way to the north, which can be given to you as gifts, but the quantity is a bit large...</div><div class="diff-line add">245063=This is not a problem, we can go and bring them back, but it has to be safe.</div><div class="diff-line add">245064=Don't worry, there are not many zombies in that area - it's the result of my long-term efforts.</div><div class="diff-line add">245065=The Level Up is complete! The newly unlocked area is above the laboratory.</div><div class="diff-line add">245066=I'll go investigate it right away -- I believe this is another surprise.</div><div class="diff-line add">245067=What? Am I dazzled? Is it another Control Center?</div><div class="diff-line add">245068=No, it's quite different from the previous Control Center.</div><div class="diff-line add">245069=Here should be the Satellite Nexus.</div><div class="diff-line add">245070=Satellite Nexus? It's unbelievable... Is there a way to restart it?</div><div class="diff-line add">245071=The device is in good condition and can be repaired.</div><div class="diff-line add">245072=Great, what are you waiting for? Just give it a try.</div><div class="diff-line add">245073=You mean there's a Satellite Nexus somewhere in the Fortress?</div><div class="diff-line add">245074=I dunno. The diary says so anyway.</div><div class="diff-line add">245075=Hey! Fernando. Shut up or get out!</div><div class="diff-line add">245076=We gotta find it ASAP. Chances are the clues are still in the Control Center...</div><div class="diff-line add">245077=I got it started. Connect the Radar now.</div><div class="diff-line add">245078=What's up?</div><div class="diff-line add">245079=...Radar connection disrupted. Someone needs to go up to the roof to check it.</div><div class="diff-line add">245080=The Radar was fixed. Let's give it another shot.</div><div class="diff-line add">245081=Done. Now we can send out and receive satellite signals.</div><div class="diff-line add">246001=Look, the detector is going off! Based on the readings, it detected Iron!</div><div class="diff-line add">246002=Guys, I think we just found some veins of Iron!</div><div class="diff-line add">246003=Awesome!</div><div class="diff-line add">246004=Ho! The Iron Mine construction has been completed!</div><div class="diff-line add">246005=Now we just need workers.</div><div class="diff-line add">246006=Assign some idle residents to the Iron Mine to begin mining!</div><div class="diff-line add">246007=My stomachs grumbling...I wonder if there's any food in the Diner.</div><div class="diff-line add">246008=You've already had three meals today!</div><div class="diff-line add">246009=Really? That many? *Sigh*...Is there any way to get more food?</div><div class="diff-line add">246010=Perhaps we should try researching "Fungus Cultivation."</div><div class="diff-line add">246011=What should we do next? You know me, I get fidgety if I'm idle for too long!</div><div class="diff-line add">246012=Let's construct a Mint!</div><div class="diff-line add">246013=We'll need coins to construct advanced facilities in the future!</div><div class="diff-line add">246014=We're becoming mightier by the day!</div><div class="diff-line add">246015=Then it's about time we fight our way back outside and expand our exploration radius!</div><div class="diff-line add">246016=Only be fighting constantly can you survive in this post-apocalyptic world!</div><div class="diff-line add">246017=-- May 3rd --</div><div class="diff-line add">246018=York was bragging about the chick he met at Brandt during tonightâ€™s patrol again. Every time man, every time he gets drunk, he starts mouthing off. Honestly, Iâ€™d wager a monthâ€™s worth of ration tickets that none of the things York said heâ€™s done were true.</div><div class="diff-line add">246019=-- June 4th --</div><div class="diff-line add">246020=Yesterday, Captain Ove led us north on a search for supplies. Everything was going smoothly until, well, it didnâ€™t. In one of the last rooms we checked, the ceiling suddenly caved in, and a zombie landed on top of us. Although we put down the zombie immediately, Johnny still got bitten. He just sat there, crying, whispering for us not to leave him, but he knew the rules. He knew we had no other choice. Thatâ€™s what I keep telling myself as well, but even so, I couldnâ€™t bear looking into his pleading eyes when I pulled the trigger. What kind of a coward am I?</div><div class="diff-line add">246021=-- June 7th --</div><div class="diff-line add">246022=Those bastards from the brotherhood are getting increasingly outrageous. If the situation continues like this, something major is going to go down for sure. Oh great, now what? Thereâ€™s some big commotion outside. I swear if the brotherhood instigates another-</div><div class="diff-line add">246023=Hey man, here comes the trouble! A small group of zombies is approaching our ground stronghold.</div><div class="diff-line add">246024=A small group... From the look on your face, I guess it won't be difficult to deal with.</div><div class="diff-line add">246025=Natalie, go to command the teams on the ground, and I will provide you with support.</div><div class="diff-line add">246026=Okay.</div><div class="diff-line add">246027=Friends, long time no see.</div><div class="diff-line add">246028=Hey, my friends! Do you know what has happened in the outside world recently?</div><div class="diff-line add">246029=What's good in a world full of zombies?</div><div class="diff-line add">246030=A great event that could affect the entire world - the "Alliance" has been established!</div><div class="diff-line add">246031=Alliance? What is it?</div><div class="diff-line add">246032=In fact, there're much more survivor squads like yours.</div><div class="diff-line add">246033=Now, they plan to cooperate, share resources, and help each other... this is the so-called "Alliance"!</div><div class="diff-line add">246034=Sounds great! But I guess that's not all you want to say?</div><div class="diff-line add">246035=Haha, that's right! In fact, many people have already joined the Alliance, and I'm just here to ask your opinions.</div><div class="diff-line add">246036=Join the Alliance?... We need to think about it.</div><div class="diff-line add">246037=That's all right. I expect you to make the right decision.</div><div class="diff-line add">246038=What is your opinion on whether to join the Alliance?</div><div class="diff-line add">246039=I know. It's hard to keep going with the few people we got.</div><div class="diff-line add">246040=So, just make up your mind, and I'll support it either way.</div><div class="diff-line add">246041=That's right! I believe you too.</div><div class="diff-line add">246042=That's fine with me.</div><div class="diff-line add">246043=... Well, let's at least give it a try.</div><div class="diff-line add">246044=Hey baby, just come over here! Otherwise, I'm not sure I'll shoot your head off with a bullet!</div><div class="diff-line add">246045=Perfect!</div><div class="diff-line add">246046=Hey, someone comes to open the door!</div><div class="diff-line add">246047=Drop your gun!</div><div class="diff-line add">246048=Damn it, what kind of hospitality is this? You just invited me here!</div><div class="diff-line add">246049=Calm down, my friend. She meant no harm. You know this is a special period.</div><div class="diff-line add">246050=Special period... You're right. So you guess if I would drop my gun as she said.</div><div class="diff-line add">246051=Understandably, this is your right - but so are we.</div><div class="diff-line add">246052=Alright, man. You have a reason. But I also came here with great sincerity.</div><div class="diff-line add">246053=I have a batch of supplies outside, but I cannot take it by myself. Can you go with me to get them?</div><div class="diff-line add">246054=Going outside? Declare in advance, don't count me in!</div><div class="diff-line add">246055=It's rare for our expert to have a clear estimation of himself.</div><div class="diff-line add">246056=I'll go with you. But don't try to play tricks.</div><div class="diff-line add">246057=Woo, the Garage is super large. Awesome!</div><div class="diff-line add">246058=The vehicle is spacious enough to fit in a whole team. Awesome!</div><div class="diff-line add">246059=That's right. It's time to fight back. Let's begin organizing the team.</div><div class="diff-line add">246060=Geez! Come over to the top of the Diner. Guess what I found?</div><div class="diff-line add">246061=Where is it? Gotta make sure it's safe enough to enter.</div><div class="diff-line add">246062=Safe enough? Huh, I can only say it's gonna be okay if we could be armed to the teeth.</div><div class="diff-line add">246063=Strength matters in this world. But what can be more powerful is money.</div><div class="diff-line add">246064=Save your words for me. Here're some Z Coins for ya. Remember, money can be your superpower.</div><div class="diff-line add">246065=Just take it. A gift for a friend. I never make bad deals.</div><div class="diff-line add">246066=Check out the stuff I picked up from all places. Take it if you like it.</div><div class="diff-line add">246067=Oh, I ain't seen any smart customer like you for a long time!</div><div class="diff-line add">246068=These're some real good stuff for Fortress upgrading. Don't regret it if you don't take it now.</div><div class="diff-line add">246069=Great deal! Don't miss out!</div><div class="diff-line add">246070=Short on Z Coins? You came to the right person.</div><div class="diff-line add">246071=You know what? I'm short on resources! How about exchanging for some Z Coins with me?</div><div class="diff-line add">246072=Signal decoded. The requester's name is Rebecca...</div><div class="diff-line add">246073=Wait! What? Rebecca?</div><div class="diff-line add">246074=Yep. What's wrong?</div><div class="diff-line add">246075=If that's not another person with the same name...that should be an old friend of ours.</div><div class="diff-line add">246076=Yes. We once lived together in a "castle" and I knew she had a crush on me.</div><div class="diff-line add">246077=C'mon. You wanna taste the bullets? Don't forget Rebecca's a sniper.</div><div class="diff-line add">246078=Alright, guys. Now locate where she is and let's move.</div><div class="diff-line add">246079=See? I said there's somethin' wrong with the radar! Waste ten more minutes like this, and Rebecca will be turned into a zombie.</div><div class="diff-line add">246080=Stop your nonsense and shut up!</div><div class="diff-line add">246081=Search again then. This time it'll work.</div><div class="diff-line add">246082=See? I told you the radar...</div><div class="diff-line add">246083=SHUT UP!</div><div class="diff-line add">246084=Stop it. It's not the issue with the radar. It's probably because Rebecca's in a car.</div><div class="diff-line add">246085=Damn! I'm done with it! Why the hell does she keep driving like that?</div><div class="diff-line add">246086=Don't worry. I found the note she left at the last stop.</div><div class="diff-line add">246087=You sure it's left by Rebecca? What language is this?</div><div class="diff-line add">246088=It's the code once used by the military in the "castle." She marked her location on it.</div><div class="diff-line add">246089=You mean the Minutemen? That is to say, you're also...</div><div class="diff-line add">246090=That's a long time ago. Okay, guys. Let's go!</div><div class="diff-line add">246091=Never expected we could find you here. Come out, dumbass!</div><div class="diff-line add">246092=Let me go, bastard! Or you'll all be doomed!</div><div class="diff-line add">246093=Huh, I don't know what's going on between you and Rebecca, but you'd better not piss me off.</div><div class="diff-line add">246094=I bet you are not as stupid as what you appear to be. Tell me where Rebecca is, and you can leave.</div><div class="diff-line add">246095=Let's wait and see! You'll pay the price!</div><div class="diff-line add">246096=Rebecca, look! This is our new home.</div><div class="diff-line add">246097=Looks pretty nice. It's not very large, though.</div><div class="diff-line add">246098=Haha. Let's go down and take a look. I promise you'll be surprised.</div><div class="diff-line add">246099=Wait, Rebecca. What's going on with the Matthew? Looks like he was trying to attack you.</div><div class="diff-line add">246100=He's with the Vindicators. I believe he had something to do with the exposure of the "castle." -- What happened then? You let him go?</div><div class="diff-line add">246101=Looks like things were more complicated than I thought. I thought the "castle" was engulfed by zombie waves. Now it turns out that a bigger intrigue was behind it.</div><div class="diff-line add">246102=Remember what people always say -- in the post-apocalypse world, humans can be more dreadful than zombies.</div><div class="diff-line add">246103=Intercepted a signal -- from the Minutemen.</div><div class="diff-line add">246104=The Minutemen? Huh, thought they disbanded already after the "castle" was taken by Zombies.</div><div class="diff-line add">246105=Check out what happened.</div><div class="diff-line add">246106=Squad 5 stuck in zombie horde. Need assistance...</div><div class="diff-line add">246107=Geez. It's Rebecca! She's alive! Rebecca, you hear me?</div><div class="diff-line add">246108=Save your efforts. She can't hear you.</div><div class="diff-line add">246109=We gotta save her!</div><div class="diff-line add">246110=You know her?</div><div class="diff-line add">246111=We lived in the same residential quarter -- the "castle" -- and I knew she had a crush on me!</div><div class="diff-line add">246112=You wanna taste the bullets? Don't forget Rebecca's a sniper.</div><div class="diff-line add">246113=She shouldn't be far from here. Locate where she is. Let's move.</div><div class="diff-line add">246114=Ohooo! This is our new home. Welcome!</div><div class="diff-line add">246115=Thanks, but show me around later. Lemme use the Radar first.</div><div class="diff-line add">246116=*Beep* ...HQ! HQ! This is Rebecca.</div><div class="diff-line add">246117=...Rebecca? You're alive? What happened?</div><div class="diff-line add">246118=We ran across the zombie horde in our quest for the Vindicators. And I was the only survivor...</div><div class="diff-line add">246119=What? But the Radar shows Woody is heading north... Don't tell me he's turned...</div><div class="diff-line add">246120=Listen, we can't leave him behind. We'll be in huge trouble if his locator is taken by the Vindicators!</div><div class="diff-line add">246121=...Got it. I'm on it.</div><div class="diff-line add">246122=Woody did a good job. His death was saddening, though.</div><div class="diff-line add">246123=Saddening? I thought you would be happy that you don't need to pay back the ration coupons you owe him.</div><div class="diff-line add">246124=I can see how disappointed you are. Well, c'est la vie. Life and death issue becomes commonplace nowadays.</div><div class="diff-line add">246125=On another note, were all your strongholds compromised?</div><div class="diff-line add">246126=Yeh, exactly. It sucks. Not a single warehouse was left.</div><div class="diff-line add">246127=Then you got somethin' to do. Ask a few friends to help you take the three warehouses back.</div><div class="diff-line add">246128=Now we go to Warehouse 9. Let's go get it.</div><div class="diff-line add">246129=Ahh. Are we gonna leave again right now? We just got here!</div><div class="diff-line add">246130=C'mon. Aren't you sitting there all the way?</div><div class="diff-line add">246131=Alright. Save your energy to kill a few more Zombies.</div><div class="diff-line add">246132=Things're going unexpectedly well. But Rebecca is in trouble now. A horde of Zombies in the southeast are approaching her.</div><div class="diff-line add">246133=Oh, hell. Why there always are Zombies wherever she goes?</div><div class="diff-line add">246134=You're right, dude. She's like a magnate to Zombies. Anyway, as friends, I believe you won't sit back and leave her behind.</div><div class="diff-line add">246135=Well done! Guys, thanks to you assistance, we took back a lot of stuff.</div><div class="diff-line add">246136=Thank you for your appreciation -- it's not as helpful as mushroom skewers though.</div><div class="diff-line add">246137=Don't worry, my friends. We Minutemen will never forget who helped us.</div><div class="diff-line add">246138=What's the plan next?</div><div class="diff-line add">246139=Stand by here. Don't forget your mission. The Vindicators will not give up easily. Stay ready for the real battle.</div><div class="diff-line add">246140=Distress signal detected!</div><div class="diff-line add">246141=â€¦Hey! Is anyone there receiving this? I am Major Rebecca of the Minutemen. I am surrounded by zombies. Requesting help!</div><div class="diff-line add">246142=It seems that we are not the only survivors. Let's lock up and get ready to go!</div><div class="diff-line add">246143=Welcome to our new home, Isn't that cool?</div><div class="diff-line add">246144=It's really cool, but I don't have time to visit. As a major of the Minutemen, I have to check if the supplies are safe.</div><div class="diff-line add">246145=Everything's fine. But our guards are missing. We gotta find them.</div><div class="diff-line add">246146=I guess they are in trouble. Let's go find them.</div><div class="diff-line add">246147=We didn't suffer much this time. But the bad news is we have a traitor among us.</div><div class="diff-line add">246148=Any idea where the traitor has gone? Let's go get him!</div><div class="diff-line add">246149=He's way more cunning than we thought. He brought the zombie waves here. Luckily, we retreated in time.</div><div class="diff-line add">246150=But his location was compromised. I'll get him myself this time. I swear!</div><div class="diff-line add">246151=Looks like there's more than one traitor. There must be something behind all this...</div><div class="diff-line add">246152=I agree. Our next move would be looking for other friends scattered elsewhere.</div><div class="diff-line add">246153=Through satellite maps, we can observe everything on the ground, thereby locking the target location.</div><div class="diff-line add">246154=Cool! Let's see where the target is!</div><div class="diff-line add">246155=Wow, I can see the Fortress!</div><div class="diff-line add">246156=Destination locked! Let's go.</div><div class="diff-line add">246157=Oh, God! There are zombies everywhere...hey, I saw Rebecca!</div><div class="diff-line add">246158=Hey, Rebecca! Are you ok?</div><div class="diff-line add">246159=You have come at the right time. I'm running out of bullets!</div><div class="diff-line add">246160=Haha, all done!</div><div class="diff-line add">246161=Thank you. I almost thought I was done. I'm glad you're here in time.</div><div class="diff-line add">246162=I was out on a mission for a while. Can anyone of you tell me how the community fell?</div><div class="diff-line add">246163=This is a long story, let's go back first. We found a nice place.</div><div class="diff-line add">246164=Guys, can you accompany me on a trip? The position has been synchronized to your radar.</div><div class="diff-line add">246165=Did the supplies get eaten by the zombies? There is nothing here except a few zombies!</div><div class="diff-line add">246166=They're my guys, bastards. What the hell happened?</div><div class="diff-line add">246167=The fatal wounds are gunshot wounds! They were shot and killed...</div><div class="diff-line add">246168=It seems necessary to take the body back for a full examination!</div><div class="diff-line add">246169=â€¦Test results came back. It was a wound from the same gun. Shot at close range. Formed not more than 3 hours ago.</div><div class="diff-line add">246170=In other words, the attackers have not gone far, we still have a chance to find them.</div><div class="diff-line add">246171=Count me in. I will make these bastards pay!</div><div class="diff-line add">246172=The target has been locked, but the risk factor in the area is high, and we need help.</div><div class="diff-line add">246173=Guys, get ready to move â€” hey! Rebecca, don't be so mad!</div><div class="diff-line add">246174=...Damn, they are also members of the Minutemen! This group of traitors, I'm gonna take them out myself!</div><div class="diff-line add">246175=...6 killed and 4 ran away.</div><div class="diff-line add">246176=This result has exceeded expectations. Don't just chase after the enemy, but also pay attention to supplies.</div><div class="diff-line add">246177=Can anyone tell me what happened to the zombies all over the floor?!</div><div class="diff-line add">246178=Looks like we're being set up. Let's find a way out of this!</div><div class="diff-line add">246179=Target is in range.</div><div class="diff-line add">246180=Good, ready to fire!</div><div class="diff-line add">246181=2 killed themselves, and the rest were killed.</div><div class="diff-line add">246182=Copy that! But I always felt something was wrong...just to be safe, prepare to retreat!</div><div class="diff-line add">246183=We got something! A geologist named Diana called us for help.</div><div class="diff-line add">246184=Diana? Before the castle community fell, the platoon commander sent her to investigate a piece of mineral that is claimed to be related to the zombie virus.</div><div class="diff-line add">246185=In other words, maybe she can help us solve the mystery of zombies!</div><div class="diff-line add">246186=Ha, this is interesting! There are ruins everywhere, I think Diana might need an excavator more than us.</div><div class="diff-line add">246187=So you can't work alone â€” Hey! Diana! Can you hear me?</div><div class="diff-line add">246188=...I'm in the innermost room, there are a few zombies outside, and I'm afraid to come out.</div><div class="diff-line add">246189=You did very well! Hold on, let us give the zombies!</div><div class="diff-line add">246190=Oh, god, thank you! thank you allâ€¦â€¦</div><div class="diff-line add">246191=Don't be afraid, it's okay, we will take you to an absolutely safe place.</div><div class="diff-line add">246192=What do you say about that mineral? I remember on the run, I put it right in the EdenCorp's building.</div><div class="diff-line add">246193=EdenCorp? This is arguably the most iconic building in the neighborhood. Let's go.</div><div class="diff-line add">246194=It's unbelievable! The community's largest EdenCorp is so desolate......</div><div class="diff-line add">246195=Now is not the time to sigh! There is a dangerous atmosphere here. It's best not to let your guard down.</div><div class="diff-line add">246196=I nearly got scared me to death by all the Zombies that came out of nowhere!</div><div class="diff-line add">246197=Shut up, you stupid pig, any more calls will draw more zombies over!</div><div class="diff-line add">246198=Stop arguing, I have already looked for it, the mineral is not here. Let's go back and talk about it!</div><div class="diff-line add">246199=The mineral is gone? How? I put it in the EdenCorp...</div><div class="diff-line add">246200=Someone should have taken the mineral, and We found traces of it at the scene.</div><div class="diff-line add">246201=The results are in. The men who took the ore should not have gone far and now there is still time to chase them.</div><div class="diff-line add">246202=Wow! I saw them! Get ready!</div><div class="diff-line add">246203=Be quiet, there are more enemies than expected, don't alert them!</div><div class="diff-line add">246204=I'm afraid it's too late! They've found us. Prepare to break out!</div><div class="diff-line add">246205=Aftet the number of people was counted, the entire population was successfully evacuated, without loss of life or injury.</div><div class="diff-line add">246206=No! I'm shot! I got shot in the ass! !!</div><div class="diff-line add">246207=All right buddy, it's just a scratch. We gotta get back.</div><div class="diff-line add">246208=These people are well-equipped and well-trained. To be honest, I canâ€™t even imagine where they came from?</div><div class="diff-line add">246209=I'm sure they had something to do with the Zombie attack. Now that their car is broken, we must not miss this opportunity!</div><div class="diff-line add">246210=According to the radar, they will enter this area in 10 minutes.</div><div class="diff-line add">246211=Ha ha! I feel enthusiastic! Wait till you see this genius!</div><div class="diff-line add">246212=Come on, boy, I look forward to your performance, don't let me down!</div><div class="diff-line add">246213=These bastards destroyed the mineral before killing themselves. Damn, the clue is broken again!</div><div class="diff-line add">246214=Don't be too upset. At least we figured out who the enemy is.</div><div class="diff-line add">246215=Yeah, the uniforms and logos they hid under their coats...They must be from EdenCorp!</div><div class="diff-line add">246216=Guys, the radar has captured new signals! A group of survivors.</div><div class="diff-line add">246217=Probably escaped from the castle community, too. There's no other living community around here.</div><div class="diff-line add">246218=Get ready to go. We'll have a new partner again!</div><div class="diff-line add">246219=There was one missing when counting the number of people just now. It was a young man named Jack Chang!</div><div class="diff-line add">246220=Jack Chang? ! We have been looking for this guy for some time!</div><div class="diff-line add">246221=Those survivors said that he was just a courier. Why did you minutemen want him for?</div><div class="diff-line add">246222=It's a long story. Anyway, he accidentally took away a piece of intel, and if he finds it, he might be able to find out what happened to the community.</div><div class="diff-line add">246223=Among the survivors who were rescued, someone said they saw Jack Chang leave alone two hours ago, heading southeast.</div><div class="diff-line add">246224=He can't go far in this short time. Natalie, can you find out where he is?</div><div class="diff-line add">246225=No problem-the target is successfully locked.</div><div class="diff-line add">246226=Dont kill me! Dont kill me! Please!</div><div class="diff-line add">246227=Don't be afraid, we are here to save you... You mean someone's after you?</div><div class="diff-line add">246228=Yes... please, help me!</div><div class="diff-line add">246229=Don't worry, we will protect you, so let's go back to the Fortress first!</div><div class="diff-line add">246230=The intel is in that letter? God, no wonder the people from EdenCorp are after me...</div><div class="diff-line add">246231=EdenCorp? Are you sure you read it right?</div><div class="diff-line add">246232=Wrong? How can it be! I saw them wearing EdenCorp uniforms with my own eyes!</div><div class="diff-line add">246233=Listen, I almost got killed! That's why I hid myself!</div><div class="diff-line add">246234=All right! Relax, you are safe, let us prepare a surprise for EdenCorp!</div><div class="diff-line add">246235=I found that there were some gunmen from the EdenCorp, and they seemed to be looking for something.</div><div class="diff-line add">246236=It's a rare opportunity to say hello to them!</div><div class="diff-line add">246237=A big win! How about opening a bottle of champagne to celebrate?</div><div class="diff-line add">246238=Don't be too happy. Those were just cannon fodder!</div><div class="diff-line add">246239=The point is, we didn't get the intel either.</div><div class="diff-line add">246240=I detected their movement, about 5km northeast.</div><div class="diff-line add">246241=Save the champagne until next time! Ready to go, guys!</div><div class="diff-line add">246242=These killers are suicidal, and the clue is broken again!</div><div class="diff-line add">246243=There may be clues on the corpse. Let's take them home!</div><div class="diff-line add">246244=The opportunity to open the champagne is gone, and the killers destroyed the intel before they killed themselves, and we're all out.</div><div class="diff-line add">246245=But at least it proves that it's got something to do with EdenCorp, and sooner or later they will show the fox tail!</div><div class="diff-line add">246246=Found a ground warehouse, there should be a lot of supplies.</div><div class="diff-line add">246247=It's time for action!</div><div class="diff-line add">246248=I found a letter left by a farmer named Harrison, who had taken refuge here and left here a few hours ago.</div><div class="diff-line add">246249=Harrison? Then we can celebrate together, guys!</div><div class="diff-line add">246250=Just a farmer, what's to celebrate?</div><div class="diff-line add">246251=If I remember correctly, before the castle community fell, Harrison seemed to be a supplier to the EdenCorp?</div><div class="diff-line add">246252=Bingo! So Harrison is very important to us.</div><div class="diff-line add">246253=Found it! Harrison is about 15 km northwest.</div><div class="diff-line add">246254=The area is packed with zombies. Hurry up! We must save Harrison!</div><div class="diff-line add">246255=It seems that there are no zombies here, please search carefully!</div><div class="diff-line add">246256=No? Is all this a conspiracy of the EdenCorp?</div><div class="diff-line add">246257=It's just speculation at the moment, but all clues point to EdenCorp.</div><div class="diff-line add">246258=The EdenCorp said before that it would send someone to pick me up...God! Do they want to kill me?</div><div class="diff-line add">246259=Iâ€™m afraid youâ€™re right, but donâ€™t worry, we will treat them well!</div><div class="diff-line add">246260=This is the place where EdenCorp and Harrison will meet. Get ready for ambush!</div><div class="diff-line add">246261=Let's hope it doesn't become another war of annihilation â€” at least let me get one alive.</div><div class="diff-line add">246262=If you learn to fight, you can't catch a bullet.</div><div class="diff-line add">246263=You are right this timeâ€”Attention, there is movement ahead!</div><div class="diff-line add">246264=Can anyone tell me what the meaning of this battle is? How many zombies to kill? Where are the people from EdenCorp?</div><div class="diff-line add">246265=I guess they didn't plan to come! Lenovoâ€™s previous community fell, maybe they have mastered the ability to control zombies...</div><div class="diff-line add">246266=Well, the usual topic! But even if this is true, the manipulator cannot stay away from the battlefield-in other words, the enemy is still nearby!</div><div class="diff-line add">246267=Hey, Brady, there are some sneaky guys in my scope, can I shoot?</div><div class="diff-line add">246268=Sure! But again, if you want to catch them alive, don't aim their head!</div><div class="diff-line add">246269=These guys are really scary, they would rather kill themselves rather than surrender! Are they brainwashed by EdenCorp?</div><div class="diff-line add">246270=But they can't destroy all the clues, at least we know that EdenCorp does have a way to control the zombies.</div><div class="diff-line add">246271=Attention. A gardener called Lafite Marceau is calling for help. At a place where used to be a plantation.</div><div class="diff-line add">246272=A plantation? If I remember correctly, that's where EdenCorp is located. That is to say...</div><div class="diff-line add">246273=Let's check it out then. Let's go, buds!</div><div class="diff-line add">246274=Oh, geez! Look at that. The place is like ten times the size of a soccer field! It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.</div><div class="diff-line add">246275=Alright. No time for complaining. Don't forget Lafite is still waiting for us. Let's split up and look for her.</div><div class="diff-line add">246276=Thank you so much! I thought I was gonna die.</div><div class="diff-line add">246277=All is over now. We'll take you to somewhere absolutely safe.</div><div class="diff-line add">246278=Here's what happened. EdenCorp asked me to cultivate a new plant. Then the "castle" was fallen. I was thus stuck in the plantation.</div><div class="diff-line add">246279=The plant... Do you still have any of it?</div><div class="diff-line add">246280=No. The place was destroyed by Zombies. But EdenCorp would transport some plants to the bio base regularly. You may take your chances there.</div><div class="diff-line add">246281=The place is more like a zombie base than a bio base... I can even hear the Zombies growling in there!</div><div class="diff-line add">246282=Looks like EdenCorp already gave up on the place. Hope they at least secured the plants Lafite grew.</div><div class="diff-line add">246283=That is. The plant! Well done, buds!</div><div class="diff-line add">246284=Thanks. Lafite, please continue your research. We need to figure out what's behind all this.</div><div class="diff-line add">246285=I need some special fertilizers. Without them, the plants won't grow. Well, the thing is, the fertilizers were all taken away by EdenCorp.</div><div class="diff-line add">246286=Umm... That's a real issue. I remember there's a barn behind the bio base. Let's see if we can find any there.</div><div class="diff-line add">246287=Over there is the barn of EdenCorp.</div><div class="diff-line add">246288=Much larger than I thought, but looks long abandoned.</div><div class="diff-line add">246289=Be careful. We'll split up after getting in.</div><div class="diff-line add">246290=Oops. It's not our lucky day today. There's nothing in there!</div><div class="diff-line add">246291=Check out the footprint. The color of the dirt is different from the soil around here. Take some and go back to analyze it.</div><div class="diff-line add">246292=We got the result for the dirt on the footprint! There's only one area nearby that has soil like this.</div><div class="diff-line add">246293=Good job. Locate where it is. Get ready to go!</div><div class="diff-line add">246294=A warehouse. The fertilizer should be in there. Telling from the growl, there're quite a lot of Zombies inside.</div><div class="diff-line add">246295=Time to flex my muscles. We've been tackling EdenCorp for a while. Can't wait to see how they beg for pardon after tasting my fists.</div><div class="diff-line add">246296=Bravo! Then I'll be able to continue with my cultivation experiment!</div><div class="diff-line add">246297=We'll count on you, Lafite. Bring back the good news.</div><div class="diff-line add">246298=Got a message from Rebecca on wireless. She's calling for help.</div><div class="diff-line add">246299=What the heck with the woman? She's been out on patrol for no more than two hours!</div><div class="diff-line add">246300=Perhaps she's in trouble, or found out something. Anyway, let's go find her.</div><div class="diff-line add">246301=You really gotta fix the 80-year-old car. I've been waiting for a good 4 hours!</div><div class="diff-line add">246302=This is the first time I see you in such a mess. Tell me what happened.</div><div class="diff-line add">246303=I'll tell you when we go back. Now help me handle the killers of EdenCorp first.</div><div class="diff-line add">246304=So you were attacked while searching the abandoned warehouse of EdenCorp? That's weird.</div><div class="diff-line add">246305=God knows what these bastards are up to. Almost lost my life there!</div><div class="diff-line add">246306=Simply complaining won't change anything. Come on, let's go teach them a lesson.</div><div class="diff-line add">246307=Target is in range!</div><div class="diff-line add">246308=Hey, Rebecca. Now it's time to let them know what it means to act against us.</div><div class="diff-line add">246309=Copy that! One shot, one kill. None of them is gonna get away!</div><div class="diff-line add">246310=Brady, why the grim look? What's up?</div><div class="diff-line add">246311=I was looking into the movement of EdenCorp. They might have a stronghold not far from here.</div><div class="diff-line add">246312=If it's not far, we might try to find where it is.</div><div class="diff-line add">246313=See? That's the stronghold of EdenCorp. We may move anytime.</div><div class="diff-line add">246314=Then what are we waiting for? Go get it, buds!</div><div class="diff-line add">246315=Heh, Fernando. Why you got so excited? Are you gonna take the lead?</div><div class="diff-line add">246316=Stop kidding me! I mean, don't you see Natalie and Rebecca are ready to have a good fight?</div><div class="diff-line add">246317=From what we got this time, we can see EdenCorp was aiming at the abandoned warehouse. There must be something important in there.</div><div class="diff-line add">246318=Looks like it's long abandoned. Not likely to find anybody there.</div><div class="diff-line add">246319=Indeed. That's why it seems so unusual that EdenCorp is interested in a place like this.</div><div class="diff-line add">246320=Hey, everybody! I'm Mario, a plumber. Are you here to save me?</div><div class="diff-line add">246321=Save you? Wait! Where did this... Mr. Chubby come from? Almost scared the shit out of me... Heh, stop looking at me like that, Fernando. I wasn't calling you!</div><div class="diff-line add">246322=Alright. Enough. Mario, how we are going to treat you depends on who you are and what you want.</div><div class="diff-line add">246323=I guess you will be happy to leave with us.</div><div class="diff-line add">246324=Of course. The first time I saw you, I knew you were not bad guys!</div><div class="diff-line add">246325=Thank you for saving my life. When I was working in the warehouse, a horde of zombies gathered outside. I got no where to go but to stay here. EdenCorp once came here, but those idiots left me here like this!</div><div class="diff-line add">246326=What did they do here?</div><div class="diff-line add">246327=They took away something. I begged them to save me. Never expected that they began to shoot at me! These bastards! Luckily, a lady with you distracted them from here.</div><div class="diff-line add">246328=I see. We got here too late. Don't worry. We'll make EdenCorp pay for what they did to you.</div><div class="diff-line add">246329=Someone responded to my radio transmissions. 20 km in NW. Isn't that an empty space? Weird...</div><div class="diff-line add">246330=Perhaps that's someone like you. Out on a mission before the "castle" was fallen.</div><div class="diff-line add">246331=Make sense. Hope the guy is one of us. But if it's someone with EdenCorp, I would get even more excited.</div><div class="diff-line add">246332=Not a bird can be seen within like 5 km. Are we at the right place?</div><div class="diff-line add">246333=Look at these traces! Someone just left. We'd better run a search carefully.</div><div class="diff-line add">246334=Search around with the Radar as well. No more than 3 hours have passed since we received the signal. The sender must be around.</div><div class="diff-line add">246335=I got something. The sender is in the north. 12 o'clock.</div><div class="diff-line add">246336=Look. A fainted woman over there! And...oh, no! Some Zombies moving towards her.</div><div class="diff-line add">246337=Oh... You attracted those brainless things towards this way. Good one, mate! Since when did you begin to do things smartly?</div><div class="diff-line add">246338=Ahem... Ha-ha, "smart" is my middle name!</div><div class="diff-line add">246339=I just got out of EdenCorp. Those people are like ten times scary than Zombies.</div><div class="diff-line add">246340=Yup. No doubt about it. The thing is... Why they are after you?</div><div class="diff-line add">246341=For my patent! I'm a breeding expert. EdenCorp wanted to have my breeding techs and I refused them. That's why they were trying to "solve the problem" in another way.</div><div class="diff-line add">246342=Where did they hold you? Don't worry. We'll get you out of the trouble.</div><div class="diff-line add">246343=Over there is the stronghold of EdenCorp. Get ready, fighters!</div><div class="diff-line add">246344=Same plan. You and me, each taking a squad. One from the front. The other from the back. Let's move.</div><div class="diff-line add">246345=Aha! A complete success! We smashed the headquarters of EdenCorp.</div><div class="diff-line add">246346=Things are not that simple. Telling from the size, it was more of a temporary stronghold.</div><div class="diff-line add">246347=Based on what EdenCorp usually does, they haven't got what they want if they let Elena live till today.</div><div class="diff-line add">246348=Exactly. I put the lab log they want in a hidden place.</div><div class="diff-line add">246349=If you don't mind, we can get it for you.</div><div class="diff-line add">246350=This is where Elena left her log? Can there be more zombies?! How did she put it in?</div><div class="diff-line add">246351=There might not be so many Zombies in the past. Anyway, clean them up first.</div><div class="diff-line add">246352=That's it! Thank god, it's still good as new. I owe you much, guys!</div><div class="diff-line add">246353=What's exactly in it? Sorry, I have to know the answer, cuz it has something to do with the lives of all of us.</div><div class="diff-line add">246354=I understand. You're my life saviors, after all. This is the bio-genetic technology. Here you are.</div><div class="diff-line add">246355=Bio-genetics... Continue the research, Elena. I believe it's gonna be of great use in the near future!</div><div class="diff-line add">246356=Got another distress signal. Wait... It's from EdenCorp?!</div><div class="diff-line add">246357=EdenCorp? My dear sniper, you did read the info accurately, didn't you?</div><div class="diff-line add">246358=Let's check it out then. Isn't this what we've been expecting? Let's go!</div><div class="diff-line add">246359=You sure someone's in there? It's only an abandoned warehouse.</div><div class="diff-line add">246360=Shush... You hear that?</div><div class="diff-line add">246361=Right behind the door. Looks like someone's locked inside.</div><div class="diff-line add">246362=Let's get closer. Be careful.</div><div class="diff-line add">246363=Thank you so much, guys! You were right. EdenCorp was the one who made the Zombie virus.</div><div class="diff-line add">246364=Tell me. Why did they do this? What exactly do they want?</div><div class="diff-line add">246365=Sorry. I wish I knew the answer. But I'm only an ordinary worker there. I don't know much about the scheme.</div><div class="diff-line add">246366=But I heard that the one who initiated the project was Dr. Luke. Yet he was against what EdenCorp was doing and left it later.</div><div class="diff-line add">246367=Dr. Luke? Where did he go?</div><div class="diff-line add">246368=No idea. But I overheard earlier he had been held at a waste recycling station not long before he disappeared. You might find some clues there.</div><div class="diff-line add">246369=Here we are. Dirty and smelly! Looks like it really is a waste recycling station.</div><div class="diff-line add">246370=Yup. The smell alone is a no-no for me.</div><div class="diff-line add">246371=Alright, guys. Not the time for complaining yet. Let's get down to business.</div><div class="diff-line add">246372=From the intel we got at the waste recycling station, there should be a stronghold of EdenCorp somewhere around 20 km away. Natalie, I need more info on it.</div><div class="diff-line add">246373=On it.</div><div class="diff-line add">246374=What? This is the so-called stronghold? EdenCorp is short of money or what?</div><div class="diff-line add">246375=Don't underestimate it. The defense here is pretty solid.</div><div class="diff-line add">246376=Be careful with every move. Don't let them run away easily.</div><div class="diff-line add">246377=From what we got so far, EdenCorp already knew where the notes were. We gotta take the notes before they do.</div><div class="diff-line add">246378=Look at there! Ah... We're busted. EdenCorp is quicker than we are.</div><div class="diff-line add">246379=They are here for the notes of Dr. Luke, too. Don't let them have the notes. Let's move!</div><div class="diff-line add">246380=What we do now? The notes must have been taken away by EdenCorp.</div><div class="diff-line add">246381=I don't think so. If EdenCorp got the notes, there will not be this many guards outside a useless stronghold. Obviously, they did not find it that easily.</div><div class="diff-line add">246382=Make sense. What are we supposed to do?</div><div class="diff-line add">246383=Simply wait for the right timing. With Bonnie, it'll be much easier to find the HQ of EdenCorp.</div><div class="diff-line add">246384=The signal is from EdenCorp? You sure, Bonnie?</div><div class="diff-line add">246385=100% sure. I was there for over six months.</div><div class="diff-line add">246386=Alright, buds. Take your arms and go!</div><div class="diff-line add">246387=This is the stronghold of EdenCorp? Don't you find it a little bit... creepy?</div><div class="diff-line add">246388=Based on rough estimate, there're around twenty armed guards. We can take down them all.</div><div class="diff-line add">246389=Great. Then surprise time!</div><div class="diff-line add">246390=From what we found, EdenCorp is looking for a woman called Cara. Any idea who she could be?</div><div class="diff-line add">246391=Cara? Never heard of the name.</div><div class="diff-line add">246392=Found it! Cara was a farmer, and a former supplier for EdenCorp.</div><div class="diff-line add">246393=Supplier? There must be something we don't know. We gotta find Cara before EdenCorp does!</div><div class="diff-line add">246394=It should be here. I can see the guards of EdenCorp from the binoculars.</div><div class="diff-line add">246395=So we attack now? My gun is thirsty for something juicy and red.</div><div class="diff-line add">246396=I'm afraid you need to hold on a while. We're here to save Cara. First make sure whether she's safe.</div><div class="diff-line add">246397=Natalie, come with me to get in. Rebecca, cover us.</div><div class="diff-line add">246398=Th...thank you. They held me there for days to find where Dr. Luke is. Can't imagine how they're gonna torture me next.</div><div class="diff-line add">246399=You know where he is?</div><div class="diff-line add">246400=No. But I was the one who took care of him. He once gave me a notebook with his researches in it. The thing seems to be very important to EdenCorp.</div><div class="diff-line add">246401=!!! Can we have the notes? Trust me, it's important for us.</div><div class="diff-line add">246402=That's what the people from EdenCorp said. But I could tell they were not gonna do anything good with it, so I made up a lie. This time, I'll tell you where it is.</div><div class="diff-line add">246403=Is this the place, Cara?</div><div class="diff-line add">246404=Yup. But looks like someone's been here. Weird...</div><div class="diff-line add">246405=I noticed that as well. That is to say...</div><div class="diff-line add">246406=Let's look around first. Hope things are not that bad.</div><div class="diff-line add">246407=Looks like EdenCorp already took away the notes. We're late again!</div><div class="diff-line add">246408=They can't be far from here. Locate them with the Radar.</div><div class="diff-line add">246409=Found their vehicles. 40 km away. 12 o'clock. Heading north at full speed.</div><div class="diff-line add">246410=Let's go. Do not let them go this time!</div><div class="diff-line add">246411=About 15 min ago, EdenCorp's vehicles entered the Facility.</div><div class="diff-line add">246412=Attack now! Find the notes of Dr. Luke as quickly as you can!</div><div class="diff-line add">246413=Now we know what's going on. EdenCorp was trying to control the world with the genetic agent "Eve." But what they actually made was the zombie virus.</div><div class="diff-line add">246414=Worse still, they pretended to be innocent and lived with us like that in "castle."</div><div class="diff-line add">246415=We shall not stand by. They must pay for what they did.</div><div class="diff-line add">246416=Dr. Luke's notes say, the headquarters of Eden is at somewhere remote. The few of us are far from enough to handle them.</div><div class="diff-line add">246417=Brady, do you mean...?</div><div class="diff-line add">246418=We'll disclose the truth and let other survivors out there know. The Minutemen, Vindicators and Wildlings... Count them in for this ultimate battle!</div></div></div>
